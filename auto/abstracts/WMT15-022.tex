This paper describes the statistical machine translation system developed at RWTH Aachen University for the German-English translation task of the EMNLP 2015 Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2015). A phrase-based machine translation system was applied and augmented with hierarchical phrase reordering and word class language models. Further, we ran discriminative phrase training for our system. In addition, we utilized multiple  feed-forward neural network language and translation models and a recurrent neural network language model in rescoring.
