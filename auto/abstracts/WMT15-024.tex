This article describes the Aalto University entry to the English-to-Finnish shared translation task in WMT 2015. The system participates in the constrained condition, but in addition we impose some further constraints, using no language-specific resources beyond those provided in the task. We use a morphological segmenter, Morfessor FlatCat, but train and tune it in an unsupervised manner. The system could thus be used for another language pair with a morphologically complex target language, without needing modification or additional resources.
