This paper targets an understanding of how metadiscourse functions in spoken language. Starting from a metadiscourse taxonomy, a set of TED talks is annotated via crowdsourcing and then a lexical grade level predictor is used to map the distribution of the distinct discourse functions of the taxonomy across levels. The paper concludes showing how speakers use these functions in presentational settings.
