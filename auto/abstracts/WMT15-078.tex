This paper introduces our SAU-KERC system that achieved F1 score of 0.39 in the world-level quality estimation task in WMT2015. The goal is to assign each translated word a ``OK'' or ``BAD'' label indicating translation quality. We adopt the sequence labeling model, conditional random fields (CRF), to predict the labels. Since ``BAD'' labels are rare in the training and development sets, recognition rate of ``BAD'' is low. To solve this problem, we propose two strategies. One is to replace ``OK'' label with sub-labels to balance label distribution. The other is to reconstruct the training set to include more ``BAD'' words.
