We offer a critical review of the current state of opinion role extraction involving opinion verbs. We argue that neither the currently available lexical resources nor the manually annotated text corpora are sufficient to appropriately study this task. We introduce a new corpus focusing on opinion roles of opinion verbs from the Subjectivity Lexicon and show potential benefits of this corpus. We also demonstrate that state-of-the-art classifiers perform rather poorly on this new dataset compared to the standard dataset for the task showing that there still remains significant research to be done.
