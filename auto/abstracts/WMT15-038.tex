This paper describes the two systems submitted by LIMSI to the WMT'15 Shared Task on Automatic Post-Editing. The first one relies on a reformulation of the APE task as a Machine Translation task; the second implements a simple rule-based approach. Neither of these two systems manage to improve the automatic translation. We show, by carefully analyzing the failure of our systems that this counter-performance mainly results from the inconsistency in the annotations.
