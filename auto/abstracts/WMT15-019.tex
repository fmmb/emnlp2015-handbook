This paper describes the UdS-Sant English--German Hybrid Machine Translation (MT) system submitted to the Translation Task organized in the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) 2015.  Our proposed hybrid system brings improvements over the baseline system by incorporating additional knowledge such as extracted bilingual named entities and bilingual phrase pairs induced from example-based methods. The reported final submission is the result of a hybrid system obtained from confusion network based system combination that combines the best performance of each individual system in a multi-engine pipeline.
