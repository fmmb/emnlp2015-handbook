This paper describes Meteor-WSD and RATATOUILLE, the LIMSI submissions to the WMT15 metrics shared task. Meteor-WSD extends synonym mapping to languages other than English based on alignments and gives credit to semantically adequate translations in context. We show that context-sensitive synonym selection increases the correlation of the Meteor metric with human judgments of translation quality on the WMT14 data. RATATOUILLE combines Meteor-WSD with nine other metrics for evaluation and outperforms the best metric (BEER) involved in its computation.
