We present the CimS submissions to the WMT 2015 Shared Task for the translation direction English to German. Similar to our previous submissions, all of our systems are aware of the complex nominal morphology of German. In this paper, we combine source-side reordering and target-side compound processing with basic morphological processing in order to obtain improved translation results. We also report on morphological processing for English to French.
