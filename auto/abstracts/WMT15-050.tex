We present the results of the USHEF and USAAR-USHEF submissions for the WMT15 shared task on document-level quality estimation. The USHEF submissions explored several document and discourse-aware features. The USAAR-USHEF submissions used an exhaustive search approach to select the best features from the official baseline. Results show slight improvements over the baseline with the use of discourse features. More interestingly, we found that a model of comparable performance can be built with only three features selected by the exhaustive search procedure.
