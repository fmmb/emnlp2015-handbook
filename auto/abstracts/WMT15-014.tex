In this paper, the KIT systems submitted to the Shared Translation Task are presented. We participated in two translation directions: from German to English and from English to German. Both translations are generated using phrase-based translation systems. Language models are built based on different tokens, such as word, part-of-speech, and automacally generated word clusters. Final systems also include bilingual language models, part-of-speech and syntactic tree-based reordering models as well as a lexicalized reordering model. In order to clean a large amount of noisy web-crawled data, we applied a filtering technique using an SVM classifier. For language modeling, a data selection strategy is also applied. A discriminative word lexicon using source context information is used or both translation directions. After generating the translation with the phrase-based system, we used hypothesis rescoring using the ListNet algorithm. We evaluated the rescoring using only the baseline features as well as using additional computational complex features.
