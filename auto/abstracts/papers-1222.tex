We present the novel  features trained with a deep neural network for Machine Translation (MT) Quality Estimation (QE). The features are learned with a Continuous Space Language Model (CSLM) by estimating the probabilities of the source and target segments. These new features along with other available MT system-independent features  are investigated on series of  datasets with various  quality labels for QE including Post Editing Effort (PEE) , Human Translation Edit Rate (HTER), Post Editing Time (PET) and METEOR score. The results show the significant improvements in predictions over the baseline as well as systems trained on previously available features set for all WMT QE tasks. More notably,  the addition of newly proposed features beat previous best systems by a significant margin on official WMT12 and WMT14 post editing effort prediction tasks.
