This paper describes the syntax-based systems built at the University of Edinburgh for the WMT 2015 shared translation task. We developed systems for all language pairs except French-English. This year we focused on: translation out of English using tree-to-string models; continuing to improve our English-German system; and source-side morphological segmentation of Finnish using Morfessor.
