This paper describes VERTa's submission to the 2015 EMNLP Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation. VERTa is a linguistically-motivated metric that combines linguistic features at different levels. In this paper, VERTa is described briefly, as well as the three versions submitted to the workshop: VERTa-70Adeq30Flu, VERTa-EQ and VERTa-W. Finally, the experiments conducted with the WMT14 data are reported and some conclusions are drawn.
