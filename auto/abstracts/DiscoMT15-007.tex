This paper describes one of Uppsala University's submissions to the pronoun-focused machine translation (MT) shared task at DiscoMT 2015. The system is based on phrase-based statistical MT implemented with the document-level decoder Docent. It includes a neural network for pronoun prediction trained with latent anaphora resolution. At translation time, coreference information is obtained from the Stanford CoreNLP system.
