We propose visually-verifiable textual entailment as a challenge task for the emerging field of combining language and vision. This task is a variant of the well-studied NLP task of recognizing textual entailment where every entailment judgment can be made purely by reasoning with visual knowledge. We believe that this task will spur innovation in the language and vision field while simultaneously producing inference algorithms that can be used in NLP.
