Parameter tuning is a key problem for statistical machine translation (SMT). Most popular parameter tuning algorithms for SMT are agnostic of the decoding algorithm, resulting in parameters vulnerable to search errors in decoding. The recent research of ``search-aware tuning'' (Liu and Huang, 2014) address this problem by forcing the tuning algorithms to consider the translation derivations in every decoding step to make promising partial translations more likely to survive the in-exact decoding beam. We extend this approach from phrase-based translation to syntax-based translation by generalizing the translation quality metrics for partial translations to handle tree-structured derivations in a way inspired by inside-outside algorithm. Our approach is simple to use and can be applied to all conventional parameter tuning methods as a plugin. Extensive experiments on Chinese-to- English translation show significant BLEU improvements in MERT and MIRA.
