Efficient computation of n-gram posterior probabilities from lattices has applications in lattice-based minimum Bayes-risk decoding in statistical machine translation and the estimation of expected document frequencies from spoken corpora. In this paper, we present an algorithm for computing the posterior probabilities of all n-grams in a lattice and constructing a minimal deterministic weighted finite-state automaton associating each n-gram with its posterior for efficient storage and retrieval. Our algorithm builds upon the best known algorithm in literature for computing n-gram posteriors from lattices and leverages the following observations to significantly improve the time and space requirements: i) the n-grams for which the posteriors will be computed typically comprises all n-grams in the lattice up to a certain length, ii) posterior is equivalent to expected count for an n-gram that do not repeat on any path, iii) there are efficient algorithms for computing n-gram expected counts from lattices. We present experimental results comparing our algorithm with the best known algorithm in literature as well as a baseline algorithm based on weighted finite-state automata operations.
