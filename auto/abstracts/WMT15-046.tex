This paper presents the results of the WMT15 Metrics Shared Task. We asked participants of this task to score the outputs of the MT systems involved in the WMT15 Shared Translation Task. We collected scores of 46 metrics from 11 research groups. In addition to that, we computed scores of 7 standard metrics (BLEU, SentBLEU, NIST, WER, PER, TER and CDER) as baselines. The collected scores were evaluated in terms of system level correlation (how well each metric's scores correlate with WMT15 official manual ranking of systems) and in terms of segment level correlation (how often a metric agrees with humans in comparing two translations of a particular sentence).
