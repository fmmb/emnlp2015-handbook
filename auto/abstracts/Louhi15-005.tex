A method to find adverse drug reactions in electronic health records written in Swedish is presented. A total of 14,751 health records were manually classified into four groups. The records are normalised by pre-processing using both dictionaries and manually created word lists. Three different supervised machine learning algorithm were used to find the best results; decision tree, random forest and LibSVM. The best performance on a test dataset was with LibSVM obtaining a precision of 0.69 and a recall of 0.66, and an F-score of 0.67. Our method found 865 of 981 true positives (88.2\%) in a 3-class dataset which is an improvement of 49.5\% over previous approaches.
