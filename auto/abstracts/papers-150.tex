Current studies on Knowledge Base Population (KBP) tasks, such as slot filling, show the particular importance of entity-oriented automatic relevant document acquisition. Richer, diverse and reliable relevant documents satisfy the fundamental requirement that a KBP system explores the attributes of an entity, such as provenance-based background knowledge extraction (e.g., a person's religion, origin,  etc.). Towards the bottleneck problem between comprehensiveness and definiteness of acquisition, we propose a fuzzy-to-exact matching based collaborative archiving method. In particular we introduce topic modeling methodologies into entity profiling, so as to build a bridge between fuzzy and exact matching. On one side of the bridge, we employ the topics in a small-scale set of high-quality relevant documents (i.e., exact matching results) to summarize the life slices of a target entity (i.e., so-called biography).  On the other side, we use the biography as a reliable reference material to detect new truly relevant documents from a large-scale semi-finished pseudo-feedback (i.e., fuzzy matching results). We leverage the archiving method in state-of-the-art slot filling systems. Experiments on TAC-KBP data show significant improvement.
