The enormous amount of information on the Internet has raised the challenge of highlighting new information in the context of already viewed content. This type of intelligent interface can save users time and prevent frustration. Our goal is to scale out novelty detection to large web properties like Google and Yahoo News. We present a set of efficient, light-weight features for online novelty scoring and a fast nonlinear feature transformation method using Deep Neural Network. Our experimental results on the TREC 2004 datasets show that the proposed method is not only efficient but also very powerful, significantly surpassing the best challenge system at TREC 2004.
