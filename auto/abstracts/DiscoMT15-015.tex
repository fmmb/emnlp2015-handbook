For some language pairs, pronoun translation is a discourse-driven task which requires information that lies beyond its local context. This motivates the task of predicting the correct pronoun given a source sentence and a target translation, where the translated pronouns have been replaced with placeholders. For cross-lingual pronoun prediction, we suggest a neural network-based model using preceding nouns and determiners as features for suggesting antecedent candidates. Our model scores on par with similar models while having a simpler architecture.
