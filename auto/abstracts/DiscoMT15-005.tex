The Idiap NLP Group has participated in both DiscoMT 2015 sub-tasks: pronoun- focused translation and pronoun prediction. The system for the first sub-task combines two knowledge sources: grammatical constraints from the hypothesized coreference links, and candidate translations from an SMT decoder. The system for the second sub-task avoids hypothesizing a coreference link, and uses instead a large set of source-side and target-side features from the noun phrases surrounding the pronoun to train a pronoun predictor.
