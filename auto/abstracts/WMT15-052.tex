This paper describes baseline systems for Finnish-English and English-Finnish machine translation using standard phrase-based and factored models including morphological features. We experiment with compound splitting and morphological segmentation and study the effect of adding noisy out-of-domain data to the parallel and the monolingual training data. Our results stress the importance of training data and demonstrate the effectiveness of morphological pre-processing of Finnish.
