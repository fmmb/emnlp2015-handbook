This paper provides an overview of our submission to the WMT15 Translation Task for the Finnish-English language pair. The submitted translations were created from a system built using the CDEC decoder. Finnish is classed as a synthetic language with elements such as nouns and verbs carrying a large number of inflectional types. Consequently, our improvements are based on morphology and include preprocessing steps to handle morphological inflections inherent in the language, and which otherwise result in lexical sparsity and loss of information.
