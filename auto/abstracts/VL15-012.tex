In this paper we present a free, open source platform, that translates in real time (written) European Portuguese into Portuguese Sign Language, being the signs produced by an avatar. We discuss basic needs of such a system in terms of Natural Language Processing and Animation Synthesis, and propose an architecture for it. Moreover, we have selected a set of existing tools that couple with our free, open-source philosophy, and implemented a prototype with them. Several case studies were conducted. A preliminary evaluation was done and, although the translation possibilities are still scarce and some adjustments still need to be done, our platform was already much welcomed by the deaf community.
