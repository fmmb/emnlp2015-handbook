The TectoMT tree-to-tree machine translation system has been updated this year to support easier retraining for more translation directions. We use multilingual standards for morphology and syntax annotation and language-independent base rules. We include a simple, non-parametric way of combining TectoMT's transfer model outputs. We submitted translations by the English-to-Czech and Czech-to-English TectoMT pipelines to the WMT shared task. While the former offers a stable performance, the latter is completely new and will require more tuning and debugging.
