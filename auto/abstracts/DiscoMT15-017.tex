We present a Maximum Entropy classifier for cross-lingual pronoun prediction. The features are based on local source- and target-side contexts and antecedent information obtained by a co-reference resolution system. With only a small set of feature types our best performing system achieves a high accuracy of 72.31\%. According to the shared task's official macro-averaged F1-score at 57.07\%, we are among the top systems, at position three out of 14. Feature ablation results show the important role of target-side information in general and of the resolved target-side antecedent in particular for predicting the correct classes.
