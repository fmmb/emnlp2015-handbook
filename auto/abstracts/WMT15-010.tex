This paper describes the AFRL-MITLL statistical MT system and the improvements that were developed during the WMT15 evaluation campaign. As part of these efforts we experimented with a number of extensions to the standard phrase- based model that improve performance on the Russian to English translation task cre- ating three submission systems with different decoding strategies. Out of vocabulary words were addressed with named entity postprocessing.
