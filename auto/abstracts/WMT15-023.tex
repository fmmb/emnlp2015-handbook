We present a hierarchical statistical machine translation system which supports discontinuous constituents. It is based on synchronous linear context-free rewriting systems (SLCFRS), an extension to synchronous context-free grammars in which synchronized non-terminals span k>= 1 continuous blocks on either side of the bitext. This extension beyond context-freeness is motivated by certain complex alignment configurations that are beyond the alignment capacity of current translation models and their relatively frequent occurrence in hand-aligned data. Our experiments for translating from German to English demonstrate the feasibility of training and decoding with more expressive translation models such as SLCFRS and show a modest improvement over a context-free baseline.
