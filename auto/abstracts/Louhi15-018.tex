This paper describes a machine learning-based approach that uses word embedding features to recognize drug names from biomedical texts. As a starting point, we developed a baseline system based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) trained with standard features used in current Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems. Then, the system was extended to incorporate new features, such as word vectors and word clusters generated by the Word2Vec tool and a lexicon feature from the DINTO ontology. We trained the Word2vec tool over two different corpus: Wikipedia and MedLine. Our main goal is to study the effectiveness of using word embeddings as features to improve performance on our baseline system, as well as to analyze whether the DINTO ontology could be a valuable complementary data source integrated in a machine learning NER system. To evaluate our approach and compare it with previous work, we conducted a series of experiments on the dataset of SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 Drug Name Recognition.
