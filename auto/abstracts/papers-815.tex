We present Lemming, a modular log-linear model that jointly models lemmatization and tagging and supports the integration of arbitrary global features. It is trainable on corpora annotated with gold standard tags and lemmata and does not rely on morphological dictionaries or analyzers. Lemming sets the new state of the art in token-based statistical lemmatization on six languages; e.g., for Czech lemmatization, we reduce the error by 60\%, from 4.05 to 1.58.  We also give empirical evidence that jointly modeling morphological tags and lemmata is mutually beneficial.
