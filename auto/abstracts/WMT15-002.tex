We define a new algorithm, named ``Drem'', for tuning the weighted linear model in a statistical machine translation system. Drem has two major innovations. First, it uses scaled derivative-free trust-region optimization rather than other methods' line search or (sub)gradient approximations. Second, it interpolates the decoder output, using information about which decodes produced which translations.
