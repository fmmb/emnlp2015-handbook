In this paper we describe the rule-based MT system ITS-2 developed at the University of Geneva and submitted for the shared task on pronoun translation organized within the EMNLP15 DiscoMT Workshop. For improving pronoun translation, an Anaphora Resolution (AR) step based on Chomsky's Binding Theory and Hobbs' algorithm has been implemented. Since this strategy works on 3rd person pronouns (i.e. ``they'', ``it'' translated as \textit{''elle'', ``elles'', ``il'', ``ils'' only), absolute performance is affected. However, qualitative differences between the submitted system and a baseline without the AR procedure can be observed.
