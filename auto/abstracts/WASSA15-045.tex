In this paper we introduce a novel computational technique of extraction of personality traits (HEXACO) of employees from Enterprise Social Media posts. We deal with challenges such as not being able to use existing survey instruments for scoring and not being able to directly use existing psychological studies on written text due to lack of overlapping words between the existing dictionary and words used in Enterprise Social Media. Using our approach we are able to infer personality traits (HEXACO) from posts and find better coverage and usage of the extended dictionary.
