This paper describes the LeBLEU evaluation score for machine translation, submitted to WMT15 Metrics Shared Task. LeBLEU extends the popular BLEU score to consider fuzzy matches between n-grams. While there are several variants of BLEU that allow non-exact matches between words either by character-based distance measures or morphological preprocessing, none of them use fuzzy comparison between longer chunks of text. The results on WMT data sets show that fuzzy n-gram matching improves correlations to human evaluation especially for highly compounding languages.
