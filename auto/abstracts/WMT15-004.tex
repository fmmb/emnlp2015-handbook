We describe the USAAR-SAPE English--Spanish Automatic Post-Editing (APE) system submitted to the APE Task organized in the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) in 2015. Our system was able to improve upon the baseline MT system output by incorporating Phrase-Based Statistical MT (PBSMT) technique into the monolingual Statistical APE task (SAPE). The reported final submission crucially involves hybrid word alignment. The SAPE system takes raw Spanish Machine Translation (MT) output provided by the shared task organizers and produces post-edited Spanish text. The parallel data consist of English Text, raw machine translated Spanish output, and their corresponding manually post-edited versions. The major goal of the task is to reduce the post-editing effort by improving the quality of the MT output in terms of fluency and adequacy.
