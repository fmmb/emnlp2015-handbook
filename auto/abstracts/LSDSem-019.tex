It is in PropBank's ARGM annotation of clausal adjuncts that sentential semantics meets discourse relation annotation in the Penn Discourse TreeBank. This paper discusses complementarities between the two annotation systems: How PropBank ARGM annotation can be used to seed annotation of additional discourse relations in the PDTB, and how PDTB annotation can be used to refine or enrich PropBank ARGM annotation.
