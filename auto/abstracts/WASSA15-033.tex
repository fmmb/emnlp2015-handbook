In this contribution, we report on an effort to annotate German data with information relevant to opinion inference. Such information has previously been referred to as effect or couched in terms of event-evaluation functors. We extend                                                  prior theory by making use of lexical decomposition and present an extensive scheme that combines both approaches and thus broadens the set of inference-relevant predicates. Applying our newly developed guidelines to the annotation of 726 GermaNet synsets, we achieve a quite high level of inter-annotator agreement.
