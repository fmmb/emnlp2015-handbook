The paper describes the first sophisticated negation scope detection system for Twitter sentiment analysis. The system has been evaluated both on existing corpora from other domains and on a corpus of English Twitter data (tweets) annotated for negation. It produces better results than what has been reported in other domains and improves the performance on tweets containing negation when incorporated into a state-of-the-art Twitter sentiment analyser.
