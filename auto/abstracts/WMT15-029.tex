We present an experimental statistical tree-to-tree machine translation system based on the multi-bottom up tree transducer including rule extraction, tuning and decoding.  Thanks to input parse forests and a ``no pruning'' strategy during decoding, the obtained translations are competitive.  The drawbacks are a restricted coverage of 70\% on test data, in part due to exact input parse tree matching, and a relatively high runtime.  Advantages include easy redecoding with a different weight vector, since the full translation forests can be stored after the first decoding pass.
