Neural machine translation (NMT) systems have recently achieved results comparable to the state of the art on a few translation tasks, including English->French and English->German. The main purpose of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) submission to WMT'15 is to evaluate this new approach on a greater variety of language pairs. Furthermore, the human evaluation campaign may help us and the research community to better understand the behaviour of our systems. We use the RNNsearch architecture, which adds an attention mechanism to the encoder-decoder. We also leverage some of the recent developments in NMT, including the use of large vocabularies, unknown word replacement and, to a limited degree, the inclusion of monolingual language models.
