In this paper, we describe the ``FBK English-Spanish Automatic Post-editing (APE)'' systems submitted to the APE shared task at the WMT 2015. We explore the most widely used statistical APE technique (monolingual) and its most significant variant (context-aware). In this exploration, we introduce some novel task-specific dense features through which we observe improvements over the default setup of these approaches. We show these features are useful to prune the phrase table in order to remove unreliable rules and help the decoder to select useful translation options during decoding. Our primary APE system submitted at this shared task performs significantly better than the standard APE baseline.
