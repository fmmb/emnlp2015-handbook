Divergent word order between languages causes delay in simultaneous machine translation. We present a sentence rewriting method that generates interpretation-like translations for better speed-accuracy tradeoff. We design grammaticality and meaning-preserving syntactic transformation rules operating on a constituent parse tree. We apply the rules to the reference translation, such that its word order is closer to the source language word order. On Japanese-English translation (two languages with substantially different structure), we show that incorporating the rewritten, more monotonic reference translation into the learning of a phrase-based machine translation system enables it to produce better translations faster than the baseline system that uses gold reference translation only.
