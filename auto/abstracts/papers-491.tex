Non-compositionality of multi word expressions is an intriguing problem that can be the source of error in a variety of NLP tasks such as language generation, machine translation and word sense disambiguation. In this work we present a method of detecting non-compositional English noun compounds by learning a composition function. We explore a range of possible models for semantic composition, empirically evaluate these models and propose an improvement method over the most accurate ones. We show that a complex function such as polynomial projection can learn semantic composition and identify non-compositionality in an unsupervised way, beating all other baselines ranging from simple to complex. We show further improvements by also training a decomposition function, and with a form of EM algorithm over latent compositionality annotations.
