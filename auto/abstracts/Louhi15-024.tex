Approaches to determining the factuality of diagnoses and findings in clinical text tend to rely on dictionaries of marker words for uncertainty and negation. Here, a method for semi-automatically expanding a dictionary of marker words using distributional semantics is presented and evaluated. It is shown that ranking candidates for inclusion according to their proximity to cluster centroids of semantically similar seed words is more successful than ranking them according to proximity to each individual seed word.
