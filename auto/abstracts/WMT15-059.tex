We describe our systems for Tasks 1 and 2 of the WMT15 Shared Task on Quality Estimation. Our submissions use (i) a Continuous Space Language Model to extract additional features for Task 1 (SHEF-GP and SHEF-SVM), (ii) a Continuous Bag-of-Words model to produce word embeddings as features for Task 2 (SHEF-W2V) and (iii) a combination of features produced by QuEst++ and a feature produced with word embedding models (SHEF-QuEst++).   Our systems outperform the baseline as well as many other submissions.  The results are especially encouraging for Task 2, since our best performing system (SHEF-W2V) uses only features learned in unsupervised fashion.
