DFKI participated in the shared translation task of WMT 2015 with the German-English language pair in each translation direction. The submissions were generated using an experimental hybrid system based on three systems: a dtatistical Moses system, a commercial rule-based system, and a serial coupling of the two where the output of the rule-based system is further translated by Moses trained on parallel text consisting of the rule-based output and the original target language. The outputs of three systems are combined using two methods: (a) an empirical selection mechanism based on grammatical features (primary submission) and (b) IBM 1 models based on POS 4-grams (contrastive submission).
