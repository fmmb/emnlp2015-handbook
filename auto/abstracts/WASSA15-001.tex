This paper tackles and evaluates the problem of performing polarity classification on Twitter over different languages, focusing on English and Spanish tweets.Three techniques are compared: (1) a monolingual model which previously knows the language in which the opinion is written, (2) a monolingual model that acts based on the decision provided by a language identification tool and (3) a multilingual model trained on a multilingual dataset that does not need any previous language recognition step. Results show that multilingual models are more than competitive and are even able to outperform the monolingual models on some monolingual datasets. As a part of our evaluation, the paper also introduces the first code-switching corpus with sentiment labels, showing the robustness of a multilingual approach on this environment.
