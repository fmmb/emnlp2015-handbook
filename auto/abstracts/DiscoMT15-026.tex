We describe the design, the evaluation setup, and the results of the DiscoMT 2015 shared task, which included two subtasks, relevant to both the machine translation (MT) and the discourse communities: (i) pronoun-focused translation, a practical MT task, and (ii) cross-lingual pronoun prediction, a classification task that requires no specific MT expertise and is interesting as a machine learning task in its own right.  We focused on the English---French language pair, for which MT output is generally of high quality, but has visible issues with pronoun translation due to differences in the pronoun systems of the two languages. Six groups participated in the pronoun-focused translation task and eight groups in the cross-lingual pronoun prediction task.
