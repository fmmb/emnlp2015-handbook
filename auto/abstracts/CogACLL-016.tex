We show that metrics derived from recording gaze while reading, are better proxies for machine translation quality than automated metrics. With reliable eye-tracking technologies becoming available for home computers and mobile devices, such metrics are readily available even in the absence of representative held-out human translations. In other words, reading-derived MT metrics offer a way of getting cheap, online feedback for MT system adaptation.
