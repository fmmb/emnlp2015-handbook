This paper describes LIMSI's submissions to the shared WMT'15 translation task. We report results for French-English, Russian-English in both directions, as well as for Finnish-into-English. Our submissions use NCode and MOSES along with continuous space translation models in a post-processing step. The main novelties of this year's participation are the following: for Russian-English, we investigate a tailored normalization of Russian to translate into English, and a two step process to  translate first into ``normalized'' Russian, followed by a conversion into inflected Russian. For French-English, the challenge is domain adaptation, for which only monolingual corpora are available. Finally, for the Finnish to English translation task, we explore unsupervised morphological segmentation to reduce the sparsity of data induced by the rich morphology on the Finnish side.
