This work focuses on using anaphora for machine translation with deep-syntactic transfer. We compare multiple coreference resolvers for English in terms of how they affect the quality of pronoun translation in English-Czech and English-Dutch machine translation systems with deep transfer. We examine which pronouns in the target language depend on anaphoric information, and design rules that take advantage of this information. The resolvers' performance measured by translation quality is contrasted with their intrinsic evaluation results. In addition, a more detailed manual analysis of English-to-Czech translation was carried out.
