Abstract#==#This paper targets an understanding of how metadiscourse functions in spoken
language. Starting from a metadiscourse taxonomy, a set of TED talks is
annotated via crowdsourcing and then a lexical grade level predictor is used to
map the distribution of the distinct discourse functions of the taxonomy across
levels. The paper concludes showing how speakers use these functions in
presentational settings.
