Abstract#==#Discourse relations are a bridge between sentence-level semantics and
discourse-level semantics. They can be signalled explicitly with discourse
connectives or conveyed implicitly, to be inferred by a comprehender. The same
discourse units can be related in more than one way, signalled by multiple
connectives. But multiple connectives arenâ€™t necessary: Multiple relations
can be conveyed even when
only one connective is explicit. This paper describes the initial phase in a
larger experimental study aimed at answering two questions: (1) Given an
explicit discourse adverbial, what discourse relation(s) do naive subjects take
to be operative, and (2) Can this be predicted on the basis of the explicit
adverbial alone, or does it depend instead on other factors?
