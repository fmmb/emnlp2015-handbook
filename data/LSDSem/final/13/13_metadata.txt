Abstract#==#Lexical cues are linguistic expressions that can signal the presence of a
rhetorical relation. However, such cues can be ambiguous as they may signal
more than one relation or may not always function as a relation indicator. In
this study, we first conduct a corpus-based analysis to derive a set of n-grams
as potential lexical cues. These cues are then utilized in graph-based
probabilistic models to determine the syntactic context in which the cue is
signaling the presence of a particular relation. Evaluation results are
reported for various cues of the circumstance relation, confirming the value of
syntactic features for the task of cue disambiguation in the context of
Rhetorical Structure Theory. Moreover, using a graph to encode syntactic
information is shown to be a more generalizable and effective approach compared
to the direct usage of syntactic features.
