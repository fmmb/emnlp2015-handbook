Abstract#==#The main contribution of this paper is a cross-linguistic empirical analysis of
two interacting levels of linguistic analysis of written text: situation
entities (SEs), the semantic types of situations evoked by clauses of text, and
discourse modes (DMs), a characterization of passages at the sub-document
level.
We adapt an existing annotation scheme for SEs in English to be used for German
data, with a detailed discussion of the most important differences. We create
the first parallel corpus annotated for SEs, and the
first DM-annotated corpus. We find that: (a) the adapted scheme is supported by
evidence from a large-scale experimental study; (b) SEs mainly correspond to
each other in parallel text, and a large part of the mismatches are systematic;
(c) the DM annotation task can be performed intuitively with reasonable
agreement; and (d) the annotated DMs show the predicted differences in the
distributions of SE types.
