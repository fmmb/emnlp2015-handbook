Abstract#==#The goal of paraphrase identification is to decide whether two given text
fragments have the same meaning. Of particular interest in this area is the
identification of paraphrases among short texts, such as SMS and Twitter. In
this paper, we present idiomatic expressions as a new domain for short-text
paraphrase identification. We propose a technique, utilizing idiom definitions
and continuous space word representations that performs competitively on a
dataset of 1.4K annotated idiom paraphrase pairs, which we make publicly
available for the research community.
