Abstract#==#Modal verbs have different interpretations depending on their context. Previous
approaches to modal sense
classification achieve relatively high performance using shallow lexical and
syntactic features. In this work we uncover the difficulty of particular modal
sense distinctions by eliminating both distributional bias and sparsity of
existing small-scale annotated corpora used in prior work.  
We build a semantically enriched model for modal sense classification by
novelly applying features that relate to lexical, proposition-level and
discourse-level semantic factors. 
Besides improved classification performance, especially for difficult
sense distinctions, closer examination of interpretable feature sets allows us
to obtain a better understanding of relevant semantic and contextual factors in
modal sense classification.
