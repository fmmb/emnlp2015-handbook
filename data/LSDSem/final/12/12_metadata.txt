Abstract#==#This paper investigates whether the wider context in which a sentence is
located can contribute to a distributional representation of sentence meaning.
We compare a vector space for sentences in which the features are words
occurring within the sentence, with two new vector spaces that only make use of
surrounding context. Experiments on simple subject-verb-object similarity tasks
show that all sentence spaces produce results that are comparable with previous
work. However, qualitative analysis and user experiments indicate that
extra-sentential contexts capture more diverse, yet topically coherent
information.
