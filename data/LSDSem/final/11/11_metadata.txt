Abstract#==#In this position paper we argue that an adequate semantic model
must account for language in use,
taking into account how
discourse context affects the meaning of words and larger linguistic
units.
Distributional
semantic models are very attractive models of meaning mainly
because they 
capture conceptual aspects and are automatically induced from natural language
data.
However, they need to be extended 
in order to account for language use in a discourse or dialogue context.
We discuss phenomena that the new generation
of distributional semantic models should capture, and propose concrete
tasks on which they could be tested.
