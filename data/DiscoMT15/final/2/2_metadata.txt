Abstract#==#In this paper, we apply text classification techniques to prove how well
translated texts obey linguistic conventions of the target language measured in
terms of registers, which are characterised by particular distributions of
lexico-grammatical features according to a given contextual configuration. The
classifiers are trained on German original data and tested on comparable
English-to-German translations. Our main goal is to see if both human and
machine translations comply with the non-translated target originals. The
results of
the present analysis provide evidence for our assumption that the usage of
parallel corpora in machine translation should be treated with caution, as
human translations might be prone to errors.
