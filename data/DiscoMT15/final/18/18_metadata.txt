Abstract#==#Current Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is significantly affected by
Machine Translation (MT) evaluation metric. Nowadays the emergence of
document-level MT research increases the demand for corresponding evaluation
metric. This paper proposes two superior yet low-cost quantitative objective
methods to enhance traditional MT metric by modeling document-level phenomena
from the perspectives of gist consistency and text cohesion. The experimental
results show the proposed metrics can obtain better correlation with human
judgments than traditional metrics on evaluating document-level translation
quality.
