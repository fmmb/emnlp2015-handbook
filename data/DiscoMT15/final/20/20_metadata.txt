Abstract#==#Research in domain adaptation for statistical machine translation (SMT) has
resulted in various approaches that adapt system components to specific
translation tasks. The concept of a domain, however, is not precisely defined,
and most approaches rely on provenance information or manual subcorpus labels,
while genre differences have not been addressed explicitly. Motivated by the
large translation quality gap that is commonly observed between different
genres in a test corpus, we explore the use of document-level genre-revealing
text features for the task of translation model adaptation. Results show that
automatic indicators of genre can replace manual subcorpus labels, yielding
significant improvements across two test sets of up to 0.9 BLEU. In addition,
we find that our genre-adapted translation models encourage document-level
translation consistency.
