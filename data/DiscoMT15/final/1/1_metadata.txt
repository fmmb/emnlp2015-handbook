Abstract#==#Coherence in Machine Translation (MT) has received little attention to date.
One of the main issues we face in work in this area is the lack of labelled
data. While coherent (human authored) texts are abundant and incoherent texts
could be taken from MT output, the latter also contains other errors which are
not speciﬁcally related to coherence. This makes it difﬁcult to identify
and quantify issues of coherence in those texts. We introduce an initiative to
create a corpus consisting of data artiﬁcially manipulated to contain errors
of coherence common in MT output. Such a corpus could then be used as a
benchmark for coherence models in MT, and potentially as training data for
coherence models in supervised settings.
