Abstract#==#Translation of discourse connectives varies more in human translations than in
machine translations. Building on Murray’s (1997) continuity hypothesis and
Sanders’ (2005) causality-by-default hypothesis we investigate whether
expectedness influences the degree of implicitation and explicitation of
discourse relations. We manually analyze how source text connectives are
translated, and where connectives in target texts come from. We establish
whether relations are explicitly signaled in the other language as well, or
whether they have to be reconstructed by inference. We demonstrate that the
amount of implicitation and explicitation of connectives in translation is
influenced by the expectedness of the relation a connective signals. In
addition, we show that the types of connectives most often added in translation
are also the ones most often deleted.
