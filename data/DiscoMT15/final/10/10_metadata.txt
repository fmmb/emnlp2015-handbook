Abstract#==#This work focuses on using anaphora for machine translation with deep-syntactic
transfer. We compare multiple coreference resolvers for English in terms of how
they affect the quality of pronoun translation in English-Czech and
English-Dutch machine translation systems with deep transfer. We examine which
pronouns in the target language depend on anaphoric information, and design
rules that take advantage of this information. The resolvers' performance
measured by translation quality is contrasted with their intrinsic evaluation
results. In addition, a more detailed manual analysis of English-to-Czech
translation was carried out.
