Abstract#==#Usage of discourse connectives (DCs) differs
across languages, thus addition and
omission of connectives are common in
translation. We investigate how implicit
(omitted) DCs in the source text impacts
various machine translation (MT) systems,
and whether a discourse parser is needed
as a preprocessor to explicitate implicit
DCs. Based on the manual annotation and
alignment of 7266 pairs of discourse relations
in a Chinese-English translation corpus,
we evaluate whether a preprocessing
step that inserts explicit DCs at positions
of implicit relations can improve MT.
Results show that, without modifying the
translation model, explicitating implicit
relations in the input source text has limited
effect on MT evaluation scores. In addition,
translation spotting analysis shows
that it is crucial to identify DCs that should
be explicitly translated in order to improve
implicit-to-explicit DC translation.
On the other hand, further analysis reveals
that the disambiguation as well as explicitation
of implicit relations are subject to
a certain level of optionality, suggesting
the limitation to learn and evaluate this linguistic
phenomenon using standard parallel
corpora.
