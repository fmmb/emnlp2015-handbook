Abstract#==#This paper presents baseline models for the cross-lingual pronoun prediction
task
and the pronoun-focused translation task at DiscoMT 2015. We present
simple yet effective classifiers for the former and discuss the impact
of various contextual features on the prediction performance. In the
translation task we rely on the document-level decoder Docent and a
cross-sentence target language-model over selected words based on the
parts-of-speech of the aligned source language words.
