Abstract#==#We present a Maximum Entropy classifier for cross-lingual pronoun prediction.
The features are based on local source- and target-side contexts and antecedent
information obtained by a co-reference resolution system. With only a small set
of feature types our best performing system achieves a high accuracy of 72.31%.
According to the shared taskâ€™s official macro-averaged F1-score at 57.07%, we
are
among the top systems, at position three out of 14. Feature ablation results
show the important role of target-side information in general and of the
resolved target-side antecedent in particular for predicting the correct
classes.
