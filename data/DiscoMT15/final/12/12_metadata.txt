Abstract#==#Most current machine translation systems translate each sentence independently,
ignoring the context from previous sentences. This discourse unawareness can
lead to incorrect translation of words or phrases that are ambiguous in the
sentence. For example, the German term "Typen" in the phrase "diese Typen" can
be
translated either into English "types" or "guys". However, knowing that it
co-refers to the compound Körpertypen ("body types") in the previous sentence
helps to disambiguate the term and translate it into types. We propose a method
of automatically detecting document-level trigger words (like Körpertypen),
whose presence helps to disambiguate translations of ambiguous terms. In this
preliminary study we analyze the method and its limitations, and outline future
work directions.
