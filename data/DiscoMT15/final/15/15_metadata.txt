Abstract#==#For some language pairs, pronoun translation is a discourse-driven task which
requires information that lies beyond its local context. This motivates the
task of predicting the correct pronoun given a source sentence and a target
translation, where the translated pronouns have been replaced with
placeholders. For cross-lingual pronoun prediction, we suggest a neural
network-based model using preceding nouns and determiners as features for
suggesting antecedent candidates. Our model scores on par with similar models
while having a simpler architecture.
