Abstract#==#Predicting pronouns across languages from a language with less variation to one
with much more is a hard task that requires many different types of
information, such as morpho-syntactic infor- mation as well as lexical
semantics and coreference. We assumed that continuous word spaces fed into a
multi-layer perceptron enriched with morphological tags and coreference
resolution would be able to capture many of the linguistic regularities we
found. Our results show that the model captures most of the linguistic
generalisations. Its macro-averaged F-score is among the top-3 systems
submitted reaching 56.5%.
