Abstract#==#In this paper we describe the rule-based MT system ITS-2 developed at the
University of Geneva and submitted for the shared task on pronoun translation
organized within the EMNLP15 DiscoMT Workshop. For improving pronoun 
translation, an Anaphora Resolution (AR) step based on Chomsky's Binding Theory
and Hobbs' algorithm has been implemented. Since this strategy works on 3rd
person pronouns (i.e. "they", "it" translated as \textit{"elle", "elles", "il",
"ils" only), absolute performance is affected. However, qualitative differences
between the submitted system and a baseline without the AR procedure can be
observed.
