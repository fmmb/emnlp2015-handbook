Abstract#==#This paper describes one of Uppsala University's submissions to the
pronoun-focused machine translation (MT) shared task at DiscoMT 2015. The
system is based on phrase-based statistical MT implemented with the
document-level decoder Docent. It includes a neural network for pronoun
prediction trained with latent anaphora resolution. At translation time,
coreference information is obtained from the Stanford CoreNLP system.
