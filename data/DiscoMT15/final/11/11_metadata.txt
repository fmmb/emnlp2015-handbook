Abstract#==#In this paper, we introduce document level features that capture necessary
information to help MT system perform better word sense disambiguation in the
translation process. We describe enhancements to a Maximum Entropy based
translation model, utilizing long distance contextual features identified from
the span of entire document and from both source and target sides, to improve
the likelihood of the correct translation for words with multiple meanings, and
to improve the consistency of the translation output in a document setting. The
proposed features have been observed to achieve substantial improvement of MT
performance on a variety of standard test sets in terms of TER-BLEU score.
