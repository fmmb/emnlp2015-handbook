Abstract#==#We describe the design, the evaluation setup, and the results of the DiscoMT
2015 shared task, which included two subtasks, relevant to both the machine
translation (MT) and the discourse communities: (i) pronoun-focused
translation, a practical MT task, and (ii) cross-lingual pronoun prediction, a
classification task that requires no specific MT expertise and is interesting
as a machine learning task in its own right.  We focused on the
English–French language pair, for which MT output is generally of high
quality, but has visible issues with pronoun translation due to differences in
the pronoun systems of the two languages. Six groups participated in the
pronoun-focused translation task and eight groups in the cross-lingual pronoun
prediction task.
