Abstract#==#Demographic attribute inference of social networking service (SNS) users is a
valuable application for marketing and for targeting advertisements. Several
studies have examined Twitter-user gender inference in natural language
processing, image recognition, and other research domains. Reportedly, a
combined approach using text data and image data outperforms an individual data
approach. This paper presents a proposal of a novel hybrid approach. A salient
benefit of our system is that features provided from a text classifier and from
an image classifier are combined appropriately to infer male or female gender
using logistic regression. The experimentally obtained results demonstrate that
our approach markedly improves an existing combination-based method.
