Abstract#==#We propose visually-verifiable textual entailment as a challenge task for the
emerging field of combining language and vision. This task is a variant of the
well-studied NLP task of recognizing textual entailment where every entailment
judgment can be made purely by reasoning with visual knowledge. We believe that
this task will spur innovation in the language and vision field while
simultaneously producing inference algorithms that can be used in NLP.
