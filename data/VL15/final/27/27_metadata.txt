Abstract#==#The context for the work we report here is the automatic description of spatial
relationships between pairs of objects in images. We investigate the task of
selecting prepositions for such spatial relationships. We describe the two
datasets of object pairs and prepositions we have created for English and
French, and report results for predicting prepositions for object pairs in both
of these languages, using two methods: (a) an existing approach which manually
fixes the mapping from geometrical features to prepositions, and (b) a Naive
Bayes classifier trained on the English and French datasets. For the latter we
use features based on object class labels and geometrical measurements of
object bounding boxes. We evaluate the automatically generated prepositions on
unseen data in terms of accuracy against the human-selected prepositions.
