Abstract#==#Semantically complex queries which include attributes of objects and relations
between objects still pose a major challenge to image retrieval systems. Recent
work in computer vision has shown that a graph-based semantic representation
called a scene graph is an effective representation for very detailed image
descriptions and for complex queries for retrieval. In this paper, we show that
scene graphs can be effectively created automatically from a natural language
scene description. We present a rule-based and a classifier-based scene graph
parser whose output can be used for image retrieval. We show that including
relations and attributes in the query graph outperforms a model that only
considers objects and that using the output of our parsers is almost as
effective as using human-constructed scene graphs (Recall@10 of 27.1% vs.
33.4%). Additionally, we demonstrate the general usefulness of parsing to scene
graphs by showing that the output can also be used to generate 3D scenes.
