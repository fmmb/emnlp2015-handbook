Abstract#==#Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have gained a
reputation for beating state-of-the-art results on
many NLP benchmarks and for producing rep-
resentations of words and larger linguistic units
that encode complex syntactic and semantic struc-
tures. However, it is not straight-forward to un-
derstand how exactly these models make their de-
cisions. Recently Li et al. (2015) developed meth-
ods to provide linguistically motivated analysis for
RNNs trained for sentiment analysis. Here we fo-
cus on the analysis of a multi-modal Gated Recur-
rent Neural Network (GRU) architecture trained to
predict image-vectors - extracted from images us-
ing a CNN trained on ImageNet - from their cor-
responding descriptions. We propose two meth-
ods to explore the importance of grammatical cat-
egories with respect to the model and the task.
We observe that the model pays most attention
to head-words, noun subjects and adjectival modi-
fiers and least to determiners and coordinations.
