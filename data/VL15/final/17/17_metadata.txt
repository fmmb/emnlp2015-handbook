Abstract#==#We address the problem of interactively learning perceptually grounded word
meanings in a multimodal dialogue system. We design a semantic and visual
processing system to support this and illustrate how they can be integrated. We
then focus on comparing the performance (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC) of three
state-of-the-art attribute classifiers for the purpose of interactive language
grounding (MLKNN, DAP, and SVMs), on the aPascal-aYahoo datasets. In prior
work, results were presented for object classification using these methods for
attribute labelling, whereas we focus on their performance for attribute
labelling itself. We find that while these methods can perform well for some of
the attributes (e.g. head, ears, furry) none of these models has good
performance over the whole attribute set, and none supports incremental
learning. This leads us to suggest directions for future work.
