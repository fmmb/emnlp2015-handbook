Abstract#==#We examine the possibility that recent
promising results in automatic caption
generation are due primarily to language
models. By varying image representation
quality produced by a convolutional neural
network, we find that a state-of-the-
art neural captioning algorithm is able to
produce quality captions even when provided
with surprisingly poor image representations.
We replicate this result in
a new, fine-grained, transfer learned captioning
domain, consisting of 66K recipe
image/title pairs. We also provide some
experiments regarding the appropriateness
of datasets for automatic captioning, and
find that having multiple captions per image
is beneficial, but not an absolute requirement.
