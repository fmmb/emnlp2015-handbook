Abstract#==#Semantic data regarding points of interest in urban areas are hard to
visualize. Due to the high number of points and categories they belong, as well
as the associated textual information, maps become heavily cluttered and hard
to read. Using traditional visualization techniques (e.g. dot distribution
maps, typographic maps) partially solve this problem. Although, these
techniques address different issues of the problem, their combination is hard
and typically results in an efficient visualization. In our approach, we
present a method to represent clusters of points of interest as shapes, which
is based on vacuum package metaphor. The calculated shapes characterize sets of
points and allow their use as containers for textual information. Additionally,
we present a strategy for placing text onto polygons. The suggested method can
be used in interactive visual exploration of semantic data distributed in
space, and for creating maps with similar characteristics of dot distribution
maps, but using shapes instead of points.
