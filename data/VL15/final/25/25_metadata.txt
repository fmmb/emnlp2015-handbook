Abstract#==#We introduce the task of visualizing distributed semantic representations by
generating images from word vectors. Given
the corpus-based vector encoding the word
broccoli, we convert it to a visual representation by means of a cross-modal
mapping function, and then use the mapped
representation to generate an image of
broccoli as “dreamed” by the distributed
model. We propose a baseline dream synthesis method based on averaging pictures
whose visual representations are topologically close to the mapped vector. Two
ex-
periments show that we generate dreams
that generally belong to the the right semantic category, and are sometimes
accurate enough for subjects to distinguish the
intended concept from a related one.
