Abstract#==#This paper describes Meteor-WSD and RATATOUILLE, the LIMSI submissions to the
WMT15 metrics shared task. Meteor-WSD extends synonym mapping to languages
other than English based on alignments and gives credit to semantically
adequate translations in context. We show that context-sensitive synonym
selection increases the correlation of the Meteor metric with human judgments
of translation quality on the WMT14 data. RATATOUILLE combines Meteor-WSD with
nine other metrics for evaluation and outperforms the best metric (BEER)
involved in its computation.
