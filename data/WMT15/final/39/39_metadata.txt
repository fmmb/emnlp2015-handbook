Abstract#==#The TectoMT tree-to-tree machine translation system has been updated this year
to support easier retraining for more translation directions. We use
multilingual standards for morphology and syntax annotation and
language-independent base rules. We include a simple, non-parametric way of
combining TectoMT's transfer model outputs.

We submitted translations by the English-to-Czech and Czech-to-English TectoMT
pipelines to the WMT shared task. While the former offers a stable performance,
the latter is completely new and will require more tuning and debugging.
