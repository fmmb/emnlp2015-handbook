Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe the “FBK English-Spanish Automatic Post-editing
(APE)” systems submitted to the APE shared task at the WMT 2015. We explore
the most widely used statistical APE technique (monolingual) and its most
significant variant (context-aware). In this exploration, we introduce some
novel task-specific dense features through which we observe improvements over
the default setup of these approaches. We show these features are useful to
prune the phrase
table in order to remove unreliable rules and help the decoder to select useful
translation options during decoding. Our primary APE system submitted at this
shared task performs significantly better than the standard APE baseline.
