Abstract#==#Neural machine translation (NMT) systems have recently achieved results
comparable to the state of the art on a few translation tasks, including
English->French and English->German. The main purpose of the Montreal Institute
for Learning Algorithms (MILA) submission to WMT’15 is to evaluate this new
approach on a greater variety of language pairs. Furthermore, the human
evaluation campaign may help us and the research community to better understand
the behaviour of our systems. We use the RNNsearch architecture, which adds an
attention mechanism to the encoder-decoder. We also leverage some of the recent
developments in NMT, including the use of large vocabularies, unknown word
replacement and, to a limited degree, the inclusion of monolingual language
models.
