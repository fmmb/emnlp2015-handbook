Abstract#==#We describe the USAAR-SAPE English--Spanish Automatic Post-Editing (APE) system
submitted to the APE Task organized in the Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation (WMT) in 2015. Our system was able to improve upon the baseline MT
system output by incorporating Phrase-Based Statistical MT (PBSMT) technique
into the monolingual Statistical APE task (SAPE). The reported final submission
crucially involves hybrid word alignment. The SAPE system takes raw Spanish
Machine Translation (MT) output provided by the shared task organizers and
produces post-edited Spanish text. The parallel data consist of English Text,
raw machine translated Spanish output, and their corresponding manually
post-edited versions. The major goal of the task is to reduce the post-editing
effort by improving the quality of the MT output in terms of fluency and
adequacy.
