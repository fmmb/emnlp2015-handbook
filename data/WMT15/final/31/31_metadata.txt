Abstract#==#We build parallel FDA5 (ParFDA) Moses statistical machine translation (SMT)
systems for all language pairs in the 
workshop on statistical machine translation~\cite{WMT2015} (WMT15) translation
task and obtain results close to the top 
with an average of $3.176$ BLEU points difference using significantly less
resources for building SMT systems.
ParFDA is a parallel implementation feature decay algorithms (FDA) developed
for fast deployment of accurate SMT
systems~\cite{Bicici:FDA4FDA:WMT13,Bicici:FDA54FDA:WMT14,BiciciYuret:FDA5:TASLP
}.
ParFDA Moses SMT system we built is able to obtain the top TER performance in
French to English translation.
We make the data for building ParFDA Moses SMT systems for WMT15 available:
