Abstract#==#This paper describes the submission of the UGENT-LT3 SCATE system to the WMT15
Shared Task on Quality Estima-tion (QE), viz. English-Spanish word and
sentence-level QE. We conceived QE as a supervised Machine Learning (ML)
problem and designed additional features and combined these with the baseline
feature set to estimate quality. The sen-tence-level QE system re-uses the word
level predictions of the word-level QE system. We experimented with different
learning methods and observe improve-ments over the baseline system for
word-level QE with the use of the new features and by combining learning
methods into ensembles. For sentence-level QE we show that using a single
feature based on word-level predictions can perform better than the baseline
system and using this in combination with additional features led to further
improvements in performance.
