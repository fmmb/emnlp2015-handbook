Abstract#==#This paper describes the system submitted by the University of Heidelberg to
the Shared Task on Word-level Quality Estimation at the 2015 Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation. The submitted system combines a continuous
space deep neural network, that learns a bilingual feature representation from
scratch, with a linear combination of the manually defined baseline features
provided by the task organizers. A combination of these orthogonal information
sources shows significant improvements over the combined systems, and produces
very competitive F1 scores for predicting word-level translation quality.
