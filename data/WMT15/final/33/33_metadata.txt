Abstract#==#We use referential translation machines (RTMs) for predicting translation
performance.
RTMs pioneer a language independent approach to all similarity tasks and remove
the need to access any task or domain 
specific information or resource.
We improve our RTM models with the ParFDA instance selection
model~\cite{Bicici:FDA54FDA:WMT15}, with 
additional features for predicting the translation performance, and with
improved learning models.
We develop RTM models for each WMT15 QET (QET15) subtask and obtain
improvements over QET14 results.
RTMs achieve top performance in QET15 ranking $1$st in document- and
sentence-level prediction tasks 
and $2$nd in word-level prediction task.
