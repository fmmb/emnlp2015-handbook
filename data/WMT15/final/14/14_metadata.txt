Abstract#==#In this paper, the KIT systems submitted to the Shared Translation Task are
presented. We participated in two translation directions: from German to
English and from English to German. Both translations are generated using
phrase-based translation systems. Language models are built based on different
tokens, such as word, part-of-speech, and automacally generated word clusters.
Final systems also include bilingual language models, part-of-speech and
syntactic tree-based reordering models as well as a lexicalized reordering
model. In order to clean a large amount of noisy web-crawled data, we applied a
filtering technique using an SVM classifier. For language modeling, a data
selection strategy is also applied. A discriminative word lexicon using source
context information is used or both translation directions. After generating
the translation with the phrase-based system, we used hypothesis rescoring
using the ListNet algorithm. We evaluated the rescoring using only the baseline
features as well as using additional computational complex features.
