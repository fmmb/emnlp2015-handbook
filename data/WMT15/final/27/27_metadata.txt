Abstract#==#Human-designed sub-structures are required by most of the syntax-based machine
translation evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation
metric based on dependency parsing model, which does not need this human
involvement. Experimental results show that the new single metric gets better
correlation than METEOR on system level and is comparable with it on sentence
level. To introduce more information, we combine the new metric with many other
metrics. The combined metric obtains state-of-the- art performance on both
system level evaluation and sentence level evaluation on WMT 2014.
