Abstract#==#This paper describes the GF Wide-coverage MT system submitted to WMT 2015 for
translation from English to Finnish. Our system uses a interlingua based
approach, in which the interlingua is a shared formal representation, that
abstracts syntactic structures over multiple languages. Our final submission is
a re-ranked system in which we combine this baseline MT system with a factored
LM model.
