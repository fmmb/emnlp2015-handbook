Abstract#==#This paper describes the submission of the University of Edinburgh and
the Johns Hopkins University for the shared translation task of the EMNLP~2015
Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT~2015). We set up
phrase-based statistical machine translation systems for all ten language pairs
of this year's evaluation campaign, which are English paired with Czech,
Finnish, French, German, and Russian in both translation directions.

Novel research directions we investigated include:
neural network language models and bilingual neural network language models,
a comprehensive use of word classes,
and sparse lexicalized reordering features.
