Abstract#==#Translated texts (in any language) are so markedly different from original ones
that
  text classification techniques can be used to tease them apart.
  Previous work has shown that awareness to these differences can
  significantly improve statistical machine translation. These
  results, however, required meta-information on the ontological
  status of texts (original or translated) which is
  typically unavailable.  In this work we show that the predictions of
  translationese classifiers are as good as meta-information.  First,
  when a monolingual corpus in the target language is given, to be
  used for constructing a language model, predicting the translated
  portions of the corpus, and using only them for the language model,
  is as good as using the entire corpus. Second, identifying the
  portions of a parallel corpus that are translated in the direction
  of the translation task, and using only them for the translation
  model, is as good as using the entire corpus. We present results
  from several language pairs and various data sets, indicating that these
results are
  robust and general.
