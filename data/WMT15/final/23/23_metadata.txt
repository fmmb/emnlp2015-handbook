Abstract#==#We present a hierarchical statistical machine translation system which supports
discontinuous constituents. It is based on synchronous linear context-free
rewriting systems (SLCFRS), an extension to synchronous context-free grammars
in which synchronized non-terminals span k>= 1 continuous blocks on either side
of the bitext. This extension beyond context-freeness is motivated by certain
complex alignment configurations that are beyond the alignment capacity of
current translation models and their relatively frequent occurrence in
hand-aligned data. Our experiments for translating from German to English
demonstrate the feasibility of training and decoding with more expressive
translation models such as SLCFRS and show a modest improvement over a
context-free baseline.
