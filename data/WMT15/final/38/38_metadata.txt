Abstract#==#This paper describes the two systems submitted by LIMSI to the WMT'15 Shared
Task on Automatic Post-Editing. The first one relies on a reformulation of the
APE task as a Machine Translation task; the second implements a simple
rule-based approach. Neither of these two systems manage to improve the
automatic translation. We show, by carefully analyzing the failure of
our systems that this counter-performance mainly results from the inconsistency
in the annotations.
