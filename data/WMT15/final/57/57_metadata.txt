Abstract#==#We present the CimS submissions to the
WMT 2015 Shared Task for the translation direction English to German. Similar
to our previous submissions, all of our
systems are aware of the complex nominal morphology of German. In this paper,
we combine source-side reordering
and target-side compound processing with
basic morphological processing in order to obtain improved translation
results. We also report on morphological processing for English to French.
