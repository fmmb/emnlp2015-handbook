Abstract#==#We propose a novel extended translation model (ETM) to counteract some problems
in phrase-based translation: The lack of translation context when using
single-word phrases and uncaptured dependencies beyond phrase boundaries. The
ETM
operates on word level and augments the IBM models by an additional bilingual
word pair and a reordering operation. Its implementation in a phrase-based
decoder introduces translation and reordering dependencies for single-word
phrases and dependencies across phrase boundaries. More, the model incorporates
an explicit treatment of multiple and empty alignments. Its integration
outperforms competitive systems that include lexical and phrase translation
models as well as hierarchical reordering models on 4 language pairs
significantly by +0.7% BLEU on average. Although simpler and using fewer
dependencies, the ETM proves to be on par with 7-gram operation sequence models
(Durrani et al., 2013).
