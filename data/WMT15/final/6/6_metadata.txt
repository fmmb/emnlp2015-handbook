Abstract#==#We present a method that improves data selection by combining a hybrid
word/part-of-speech representation for corpora, with the idea of distinguishing
between rare and frequent events. We validate our approach using data selection
for machine translation, and show that it maintains or improves BLEU and TER
translation scores while substantially improving vocabulary coverage and
reducing data selection model size. Paradoxically, the coverage improvement is
achieved by abstracting away over 97% of the total training corpus vocabulary
using simple part-of-speech tags during the data selection process.
