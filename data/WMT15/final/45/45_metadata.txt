Abstract#==#This paper describes USAAR's submission to the the {\itshape metrics shared
task} of the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) in 2015.
The goal of our submission is to take advantage of the semantic overlap between
hypothesis and reference translation for predicting MT output adequacy using
language independent document embeddings. 
The approach presented here is learning a Bayesian Ridge Regressor using
document skip-gram embeddings in order to automatically evaluate Machine
Translation (MT) output by predicting semantic adequacy scores.
The evaluation of our submission -- measured by the correlation with human
judgements -- shows promising results on system-level scores.
