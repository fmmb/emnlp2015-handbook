Abstract#==#We present an experimental statistical tree-to-tree machine translation system
based on the multi-bottom up tree transducer including rule extraction, tuning
and decoding.  Thanks to input parse forests and a ``no pruning'' strategy
during decoding, the obtained translations are competitive.  The drawbacks are
a restricted coverage of 70\% on test data, in part due to exact input parse
tree matching, and a relatively high runtime.  Advantages include easy
redecoding with a different weight vector, since the full translation forests
can be stored after the first decoding pass.
