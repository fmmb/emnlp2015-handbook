Abstract#==#This article describes the Aalto University entry to the English-to-Finnish
shared translation task in WMT 2015. The system participates in the constrained
condition, but in addition we impose some further constraints, using no
language-specific resources beyond those provided in the task. We use a
morphological segmenter, Morfessor FlatCat, but train and tune it in an
unsupervised manner. The system could thus be used for another language pair
with a morphologically complex target language, without needing modification or
additional resources.
