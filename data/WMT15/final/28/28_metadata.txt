Abstract#==#The log-linear combination of different features is an important component of
SMT systems. It allows for the easy integartion of models into the system and
is used during decoding as well as for n-best list rescoring. With the recent
success of more complex models like neural network-based translation models,
n-best list rescoring attracts again more attention. In this work, we present
a new technique to train the log-linear model based on the ListNet algorithm.
This technique scales to many features, considers the whole list and not single
entries during learning and can also be applied to more complex models than a
log-linear combination.  Using the new learning approach, we improve the
translation quality of a large-scale system by 0.8 BLEU points during rescoring
and generate translations which are up to 0.3 BLEU points better than other
learning techniques such as MERT or MIRA.
