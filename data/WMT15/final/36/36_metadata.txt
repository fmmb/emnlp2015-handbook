Abstract#==#We describe the submissions of ILLC UvA to metric and tuning tasks on WMT15.
Both submissions are based on BEER evaluation metric originally presented on
WMT14 (Stanojevic and Sima’an, 2014a). The main changes introduced this year
are: (i) extenssion of learning-to-rank trained sentence level metric to corpus
level (but still decomposable to sentence level) (ii) incorporation of
syntactic ingradients based on dependency trees and (iii) technique for finding
parameters of BEER to avoid “gaming of the metric” during tuning.
