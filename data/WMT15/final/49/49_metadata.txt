Abstract#==#For several languages only potentially non-projective dependency parses are
readily available.  Projectivizing the parses and utilizing them in
syntax-based translation systems often yields particularly bad translation
results indicating that those translation models cannot properly utilize such
information.  We   demonstrate that our system based on multi bottom-up tree
transducers, which can natively handle discontinuities, can avoid the large
translation quality deterioration, achieve the best performance of all
classical syntax-based translation systems, and close the gap to phrase-based
and hierarchical systems that do not utilize syntax.
