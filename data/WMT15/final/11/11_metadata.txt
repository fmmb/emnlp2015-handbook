Abstract#==#In this paper, we enhance the traditional confusion network system combination
approach with an additional model trained by a neural network. This work is
motivated by the fact that the commonly used binary system voting models only
assign each input system a global weight which is responsible for the global
impact of each input system on all translations. This prevents individual
systems with low system weights from having influence on the system combination
output, although in some situations this could be helpful. Further, words which
have only been seen by one or few systems rarely have a chance of being present
in the combined output. We train a local system voting model by a neural
network which is based on the words themselves and the combinatorial
occurrences of the different system outputs. This gives system combination the
option to prefer other systems at different word positions even for the same
sentence.
