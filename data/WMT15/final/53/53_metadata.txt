Abstract#==#This paper provides an overview of our
submission to the
WMT15 Translation Task for the
Finnish-English language pair. The submitted
translations were created from a
system built using the CDEC decoder.
Finnish is classed as a synthetic language
with elements such as nouns and verbs carrying
a large number of inflectional types. Consequently, our improvements
are based on morphology and
include preprocessing steps to handle morphological inflections inherent
in the language, and which otherwise
result in lexical sparsity and loss of information.
