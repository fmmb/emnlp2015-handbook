Abstract#==#We present the results of the USHEF and USAAR-USHEF submissions for the WMT15
shared task on document-level quality estimation. The USHEF submissions
explored several document and discourse-aware features. The USAAR-USHEF
submissions used an exhaustive search approach to select the best features from
the official baseline. Results show slight improvements over the baseline with
the use of discourse features. More interestingly, we found that a model of
comparable performance can be built with only three features selected by the
exhaustive search procedure.
