Abstract#==#This paper describes the AFRL-MITLL statistical MT system and the improvements
that were developed during the WMT15 evaluation campaign. As part of these
efforts we experimented with a number of extensions to the standard phrase-
based model that improve performance on the Russian to English translation task
cre- ating three submission systems with different decoding strategies. Out of
vocabulary words were addressed with named entity postprocessing.
