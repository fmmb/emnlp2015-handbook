Abstract#==#This paper describes the LeBLEU evaluation score for machine translation,
submitted to WMT15 Metrics Shared Task. LeBLEU extends the popular BLEU score
to consider fuzzy matches between n-grams. While there are several variants of
BLEU that allow non-exact matches between words either by character-based
distance measures or morphological preprocessing, none of them use fuzzy
comparison between longer chunks of text. The results on WMT data sets show
that fuzzy n-gram matching improves correlations to human evaluation especially
for highly compounding languages.
