Abstract#==#This paper describes the Universitat d'Alacant submissions (labelled as
UAlacant) for the machine translation quality estimation (MTQE) shared task in
WMT 2015, where we participated in the word-level MTQE sub-task. The method we
used to produce our submissions uses external sources of bilingual information
as a "black box" to spot sub-segment correspondences between a source segment S
and the translation hypothesis T produced by a machine translation system. This
is done by segmenting both S and T into overlapping sub-segments of variable
length and translating them in both translation directions, using the available
sources of bilingual information "on the fly". For our submissions, two sources
of bilingual information were used: machine translation (Apertium and Google
Translate) and the bilingual concordancer Reverso Context. After obtaining the
sub-segment correspondences, a collection of features is extracted from them,
which are then used by a binary classifer to obtain the final "GOOD" or "BAD"
word-level quality labels. We prepared two submissions for this year's edition
of WMT 2015: one using the features produced by our system, and one combining
them with the baseline features published by the organisers of the task, which
were ranked third and first for the sub-task, respectively.
