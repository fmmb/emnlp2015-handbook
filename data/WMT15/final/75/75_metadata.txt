Abstract#==#We show that, consistent with MEANTtuned systems that translate into Chinese,
MEANT-tuned MT systems that translate into English also outperforms BLEUtuned
systems across commonly used MT evaluation metrics, even in BLEU. The result
is achieved by significantly improving MEANTâ€™s sentence-level ranking
correlation with human preferences through incorporating a more accurate
distributional semantic model for lexical similarity and a novel backoff
algorithm for evaluating MT output which automatic semantic parser fails to
parse. The surprising result of MEANT-tuned systems having a higher BLEU score
than BLEU-tuned systems suggests that MEANT is a more accurate objective
function guiding the development of MT systems towards producing more adequate
translation.
