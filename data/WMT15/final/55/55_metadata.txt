Abstract#==#DFKI participated in the shared translation task of WMT 2015 with the
German-English language pair in each translation direction. The submissions
were generated using an experimental hybrid system based on three systems: a
dtatistical Moses system, a commercial rule-based system, and a serial coupling
of the two where the output of the rule-based system is further translated by
Moses trained on parallel text consisting of the rule-based output and the
original target language. The outputs of three systems are combined using two
methods: (a) an empirical selection mechanism based on grammatical features
(primary submission) and (b) IBM 1 models based on POS 4-grams (contrastive
submission).
