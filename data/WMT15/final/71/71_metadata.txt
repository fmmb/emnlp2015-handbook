Abstract#==#This paper presents our metric (UoW- LSTM) submitted in the WMT-15 metrics
task. Many state-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) evaluation metrics are
complex, involve extensive external resources (e.g. for paraphrasing) and
require tuning to achieve the best results. We use a metric based on dense
vector spaces and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are types of
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). For WMT- 15 our new metric is the best
performing metric overall according to Spearman and Pearson (Pre-TrueSkill) and
second best according to Pearson (TrueSkill) system level correlation.
