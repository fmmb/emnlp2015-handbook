Abstract#==#This paper presented the joined submission of KIT and LIMSI to the English to
German translation task of WMT 2015. 
In this years submission, we integrated a neural network-based translation
model into a phrase-based translation model by rescoring the n-best lists. 

Since the computation complexity is one of the main issues for continuous space
models, we compared two techniques to reduce the computation cost. 
We investigated models using a structured output layer as well as models
trained with noise contrastive estimation. 
Furthermore, we evaluated a new method to obtain the best log-linear
combination in the rescoring phase. 

Using these techniques, we were able to improve the BLEU score of the baseline
phrase-based system by 1.4 BLEU points.
