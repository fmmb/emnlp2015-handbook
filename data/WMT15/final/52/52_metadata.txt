Abstract#==#This paper describes baseline systems for Finnish-English and
English-Finnish machine translation using standard phrase-based and
factored models including morphological features. We experiment with
compound splitting and morphological segmentation and study the effect
of adding noisy out-of-domain data to the parallel and the monolingual
training data. Our results stress the importance of training data and
demonstrate the effectiveness of morphological pre-processing of Finnish.
