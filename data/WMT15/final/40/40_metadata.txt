Abstract#==#An important limitation of automatic evaluation metrics is that, when comparing
Machine Translation (MT) to a human reference, they are often unable to
discriminate between acceptable variation and the differences that are
indicative of MT
errors. In this paper we present UPF-Cobalt evaluation system that addresses
this issue by penalizing the differences in syntactic context of aligned
candidate and reference words. We evaluate our metric using the data from WMT
workshops of the recent years and show that it performs competitively both at
segment and at system levels.
