Abstract#==#We propose the use of character n-gram F-score for automatic evaluation
of machine translation output. Character n-grams have already been used as a
part of more complex metrics, but their individual potential has not been
investigated yet. We report system-level correlations with human rankings for
6-gram F1-score (chrF) on the WMT12, WMT13 and WMT14 data as
well as segment-level correlation for 6-gram F1 (chrF) and F3-scores (chrF3) on
WMT14 data for all available target languages. The results are very
promising, especially for the chrF3 score -- for translation from
English, this variant showed the highest 
segment-level correlations outperforming even the best metrics on the
WMT14 shared evaluation task.
