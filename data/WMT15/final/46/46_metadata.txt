Abstract#==#This paper presents the results of the WMT15 Metrics Shared Task. We asked
participants of this task to score the outputs of the MT systems involved in
the WMT15 Shared Translation Task. We collected scores of 46 metrics from 11
research groups. In addition to that, we computed scores of 7 standard metrics
(BLEU, SentBLEU, NIST, WER, PER, TER and CDER) as baselines. The collected
scores were
evaluated in terms of system level correlation (how well each metric's scores
correlate with WMT15 official manual ranking of systems) and in terms of
segment
level correlation (how often a metric agrees with humans in comparing two
translations of a particular sentence).
