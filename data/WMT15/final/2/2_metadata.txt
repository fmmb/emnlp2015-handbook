Abstract#==#We define a new algorithm, named "Drem", for tuning the weighted linear model
in a statistical machine translation system. Drem has two major innovations.
First, it uses scaled derivative-free trust-region optimization rather than
other methods' line search or (sub)gradient approximations. Second, it
interpolates the decoder output, using information about which decodes produced
which translations.
