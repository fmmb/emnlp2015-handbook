Abstract#==#This paper presents the results of the WMT15 Tuning Shared Task. We provided
the
participants of this task with a complete machine translation system and asked
them to tune its
internal parameters (feature weights). The tuned systems were used to translate
the test set and
the outputs were manually ranked for translation quality. We received 4
submissions in the
English-Czech and 6 in the Czech-English translation direction. In addition, we
ran
3 baseline setups, tuning the
parameters with standard optimizers for BLEU score.
