Abstract#==#We show that metrics derived from recording gaze while reading, are better
proxies for machine translation quality than automated metrics. With reliable
eye-tracking technologies becoming available for home computers and mobile
devices, such metrics are readily available even in the absence of
representative held-out human translations. In other words, reading-derived MT
metrics offer a way of getting cheap, online feedback for MT system adaptation.
