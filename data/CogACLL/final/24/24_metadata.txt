Abstract#==#This study investigates the use of syllables and phone(me)s in computational
models of segmentation in early language acquisition. We results of experiments
with both syllables and phonemes as the basic unit using a standard
state-of-the-art segmentation model. We evaluate the model output based on both
word- and morpheme-segmented gold standards on child-directed speech corpora
from two typologically different languages. Our results do not indicate a clear
advantage for one unit or the other. We argue that the computational advantage
for the syllable suggested in earlier research may be an artifact of the
particular language and/or segmentation strategy used in these studies.
