Abstract#==#Redundancy is an important psycholinguistic concept which is often used for
explanations of language change, but is notoriously diffi-cult to
operationalize and measure. Assum-ing that the reconstruction of a syntactic
structure by a parser can be used as a rough model of the understanding of a
sentence by a human hearer, I propose a method for es-timating redundancy. The
key idea is to compare performances of a parser on a giv-en treebank before and
after artificially re-moving all information about a certain grammeme from the
morphological annota-tion. The change in performance can be used as an estimate
for the redundancy of the grammeme. I perform an experiment, apply-ing
MaltParser to an Old Church Slavonic treebank to estimate grammeme redundancy
in Proto-Slavic. The results show that those Old Church Slavonic grammemes
within the case, number and tense categories that were estimated as most
redundant are those that disappeared in modern Russian. Moreover, redundancy
estimates serve as a good predic-tor of case grammeme frequencies in modern
Russian. The small sizes of the samples do not allow to make definitive
conclusions for number and tense.
