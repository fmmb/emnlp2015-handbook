Abstract#==#We address the question whether children can acquire mature use of higher-level
grammatical choices from the linguistic input, given only general prior
knowledge and learning biases. We do so on the basis of a case study with the
dative alternation in English,
building on a study by De Marneffe et al. (2012) who model the production of
the dative alternation by seven young children, using data from the Child
Language Data Exchange System corpus. Using mixed-effects logistic modelling on
the aggregated data of these  children, De Marneffe et al. report that the
children's choices can be predicted both by their own utterances and by
child-directed speech. Here we bring the computational modeling down to the
individual child, using memory-based learning and incremental learning curve
studies. We observe that for all children, their dative choices are best
predicted by a model trained on child-directed speech. Yet, models trained on
two individual children for which sufficient data is available are about as
accurate. Furthermore, models trained on the dative alternations of these
children provide approximations of dative alternations in caregiver speech that
are about as accurate as training and testing on caregiver data only.
