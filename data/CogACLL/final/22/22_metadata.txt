Abstract#==#Experiments on the emergence of a shared language in a population of agents
usually rely on the control of the complexity by the experimenter. In this
article we show how agents provided with the autotelic principle, a system by
which agents can regulate their own development, progressively develop an
emerging language evolving from one word to multi-word utterances, increasing
its discriminative power.
