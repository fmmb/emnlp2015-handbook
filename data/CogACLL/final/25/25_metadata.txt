Abstract#==#Meaning conveyance is bottlenecked by the linguistic conventions shared among
interlocutors. One possibility to convey non-conventionalized meaning is to
employ known expressions in such a way that the intended meaning can be abduced
from them. This, in turn, can give rise to ambiguity. We investigate this
process with a focus on its use for semantic coordination and show it to be
conducive to fast agreement on novel meaning under a mutual expectation to
exploit semantic structure. We argue this to be a motivation for the
cross-linguistic pervasiveness of systematic ambiguity.
