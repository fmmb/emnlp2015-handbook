Abstract#==#In this paper, a particular algorithm for lexical acquisition - taken as a
problem of learning the mapping from words to meanings - is evaluated. The
algorithm in Siskind (1996) is adapted to handle more complex input data,
including data of Brazilian Portuguese. In particular, the input data in the
present study covers a broader grammatical knowledge, showing both polysemy and
higher inflectional and agreement morphology. Results indicate that these
properties create difficulties to the learner and that more substantial
developments to the algorithm are needed in order to increase its
cross-linguistic capabilities.
