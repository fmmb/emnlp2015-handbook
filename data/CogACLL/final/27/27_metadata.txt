Abstract#==#In understanding human language processing system, there are two important
aspects addressed independently: how to explain people’s reading difficulty,
i.e., predicting reaction times, and how the linguistic system balances reuse
and storage of lexical units for productive computation, i.e., how often
frequently used structures are cached. Despite much work on each of these
individual topics, none has addressed the problem of finding which grain-size
of lexical units best predicts reaction times. In this paper, we examine
several models of productivity and reuse, previously proposed to study
morphology, in the syntax realm. Specifically, we demonstrate on both the
Dundee eye-tracking corpus and the MIT reading time corpus, that fragment
grammars, a model that optimizes the tradeoff between computation and storage,
is able to better explain people’s reaction times than two baseline models
which favor either storage or computation exclusively. Additionally, we make a
contribution by extending an existing incremental parser to handle more general
grammars and scale well to larger rule and data sets.
