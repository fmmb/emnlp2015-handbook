Abstract#==#Children's overextension errors in word usage can yield insights into the
underlying representation of meaning.
We simulate overextension patterns in the domain of color with two
word-learning models, and look at the contribution of three possible factors:
perceptual properties of the colors, typological prevalence of certain color
groupings into categories (as a proxy for cognitive naturalness), and color
term frequency. We find that the perceptual features provide the strongest
predictors of the error pattern observed during development, and can
effectively rule out color term frequency as an explanation. Typological
prevalence is shown to correlate strongly with the perceptual dimensions of
color, and hence provides no effect over and above the perceptual dimensions.
