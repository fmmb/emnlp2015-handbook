Abstract#==#We aim to demonstrate that agent-based models can be a useful
tool for historical linguists, by modeling the historical development of verbal
cluster word order in Germanic languages. Our results show that the current
order in German may have developed due to increased use of subordinate clauses,
while the English order is predicted to be influenced by the grammaticalization
of the verb 'to have'. The methodology we use makes few assumptions, making it
broadly applicable to other phenomena of language change.
