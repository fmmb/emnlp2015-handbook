Abstract#==#Starting from the distributional bootstrapping hypothesis, we propose an
unsupervised model that selects the most useful distributional information
according to its salience in the input, incorporating psycholinguistic
evidence. With a supervised Parts-of-Speech tagging experiment, we provide
preliminary results suggesting that the distributional contexts extracted by
our model yield similar performances as compared to current approaches from the
literature, with a gain in psychological plausibility. We also introduce a more
principled way to evaluate the effectiveness of distributional contexts in
helping learners to group words in syntactic categories.
