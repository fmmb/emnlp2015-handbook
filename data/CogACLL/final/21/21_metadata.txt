Abstract#==#Infant-directed speech (IDS) is thought to play a key role in determining
infant language acquisition. It is thus important to describe how computational
models of infant language acquisition behave when given an input of IDS, as
compared to adult-directed speech (ADS). In this paper, we explore how an
acoustic motif discovery algorithm fares when presented with speech from both
registers. Results show small but significant differences in performance, with
lower recall and lower cluster collocation in IDS than ADS, but a higher
cluster purity in IDS. Overall, these results are inconsistent with a view
suggesting that IDS is acoustically clearer than ADS in a way that
systematically facilitates lexical recognition. Similarities and differences
with human infants' word segmentation are discussed.
