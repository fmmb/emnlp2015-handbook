Abstract#==#This paper investigates to what extent grammatical functions of a word can be
predicted from gaze features obtained using eye-tracking. A recent study showed
that reading behavior can be used to predict coarse-grained part of speech, but
we go beyond this, and show that gaze features can also be used to make more
fine-grained distinctions between grammatical functions, e.g., subjects and
objects. In addition, we show that gaze features can be used to improve a
discriminative transition-based dependency parser.
