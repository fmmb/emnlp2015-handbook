Abstract#==#We present a prototype model, based on a combination of count-based
distributional semantics and prediction-based neural word embeddings, which
learns about syntactic categories as a function of (1) writing contextual,
phonological, and lexical-stress-related information to memory and (2)
predicting upcoming context words based on memorized information. The system is
a first step towards utilizing recently popular methods from Natural Language
Processing for exploring the role of prediction in childrens' acquisition of
syntactic categories.
