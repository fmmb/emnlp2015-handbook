Abstract#==#With microblogging platforms such as Twitter generating huge amounts of textual
data every day, the possibilities of knowledge discovery through Twitter data
becomes increasingly relevant. Similar to the public voting mechanism on
websites such as the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) that aggregates movies
ratings, Twitter content contains reflections of public opinion about movies.
This study aims to explore the use of Twitter content as textual data for
predictive text mining. In this study, a corpus of tweets was compiled to
predict the rating scores of newly released movies on IMDb. Predictions were
done with several different machine learning algorithms, exploring both
regression and classification methods. In addition, this study explores the use
of several different kinds of textual features in the machine learning tasks.
Results show that prediction performance based on textual features derived from
our corpus of tweets improved on the baseline for both regression and
classification tasks.
