Abstract#==#Opinion mining aims at summarizing the content of reviews for a specific brand,
product, or manufacturer. However, the actual desire of a user is often one
step further: Produce a ranking corresponding to specific needs such that a
selection process is supported. In this work, we aim towards closing this gap.
We present the task to rank products based on sentiment information and discuss
necessary steps towards addressing this task. This includes, on the one hand,
the identification of gold rankings as a fundament for an objective function
and evaluation and, on the other hand, methods to rank products based on review
information. To demonstrate early results on that task, we employ real world
examples of rankings as gold standard that are of interest to potential
customers as well as product managers, in our case the sales ranking provided
by Amazon.com and the quality ranking by Snapsort.com. As baseline methods, we
use the average star ratings and review frequencies. Our best text-based
approximation of the sales ranking achieves a Spearman's correlation
coefficient of ρ=0.23. On the Snapsort data, a ranking based on extracting
comparisons leads to  ρ=0.51. In addition, we show that aspect-specific
rankings can be used to measure the impact of specific aspects on the ranking.
