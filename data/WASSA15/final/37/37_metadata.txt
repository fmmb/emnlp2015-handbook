Abstract#==#Contemporary sentiment analysis approaches rely heavily on lexicon based
methods. This is mainly due to their simplicity, although the best empirical
results can be achieved by more complex techniques.We introduce a method to
assess suitability of generic sentiment lexicons for a given domain, namely to
identify frequent bigrams where a polar word switches polarity. Our bigrams are
scored using Lexicographers Mutual Information and leveraging large
automatically obtained corpora. Our score matches human perception of polarity
and demonstrates improvements in classification results using our enhanced
context-aware method.
Our method enhances the assessment of lexicon based sentiment detection
algorithms and can be further used to quantify ambiguous words.
