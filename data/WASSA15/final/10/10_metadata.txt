Abstract#==#On an e-commerce site, product blurbs (short promotional statements) and user
reviews give us a lot of information about products. While a blurb should be
appealing to encourage more users to click on a product link, sometimes sellers
may miss or misunderstand which aspects of the product are important to their
users. We therefore propose a novel task: suggesting aspects of products for an
advertisement improvement. As reviews have a lot of information about aspects
from the perspective of users, review analysis enables us to suggest aspects
that could attract more users. To achieve this, we break this task into the
following two subtasks: aspect grouping and aspect group ranking. Aspect
grouping enables us to treat product aspects at the semantic level rather than
expression level. Aspect group ranking allows us to show users only aspects
important for them. On the basis of experimental results using travel domain
hotel data, we show that our proposed solution accomplishes NDCG@3 score of
0.739, which shows our solution is effective in achieving our goal.
