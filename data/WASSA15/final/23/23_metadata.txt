Abstract#==#Agile social media analysis involves building bespoke, one-off classification
pipelines tailored to the analysis of specific datasets. In this study we
investigate how the DUALIST architecture can be optimised for agile social
media analysis. We evaluate several semi-supervised learning algorithms in
conjunction with a Naive Bayes model, and show how these modifications can
improve the performance of bespoke classifiers for a variety of tasks on a
large range of datasets.
