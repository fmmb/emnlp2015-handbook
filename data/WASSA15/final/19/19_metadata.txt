Abstract#==#This short paper describes a sentiment analysis system for micro-post data that
includes analysis of tweets from Twitter and Short Messaging Service (SMS) text
messages. We discuss our system that makes use of Word Sense Disambiguation
techniques in sentiment analysis at the message level, where the entire tweet
or SMS text was analysed to determine its dominant sentiment. Previous work
done in the area of Word Sense Disambiguation does not throw light on its
influence on the analysis of social-media text and micropost data, which is
what our work aims to achieve. Our experiments show that the use of Word Sense
Disambiguation alone has resulted in an improved sentiment analysis system that
outperforms systems built without incorporating Word Sense Disambiguation.
