Abstract#==#Sentiment lexicons and other linguistic knowledge proved to be beneficial in
polarity classification. This paper introduces a linguistically informed
Convolutional Neural Network (lingCNN), which incorporates this valuable kind
of information into the model. We present two intuitive and simple methods: The
first one integrates word-level features, the second sentence-level features.
By combining both types of features our model achieves results that are
comparable to state-of-the-art systems.
