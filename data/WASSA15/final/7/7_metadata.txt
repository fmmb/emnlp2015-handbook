Abstract#==#Sarcasm understanding may require information beyond the text itself, as in the
case of `I absolutely love this restaurant!' which may be sarcastic, depending
on the contextual situation. We present the first quantitative evidence to show
that historical tweets by an author can provide additional context for sarcasm
detection. Our sarcasm detection approach uses two components: a contrast-based
predictor (that identifies if there is a sentiment contrast within a target
tweet), and a historical tweet-based predictor (that identifies if the
sentiment expressed towards an entity in  the target tweet agrees with
sentiment expressed by the author towards that tweet in the past).
