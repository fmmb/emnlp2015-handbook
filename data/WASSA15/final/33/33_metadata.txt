Abstract#==#In this contribution, we report on an effort to annotate German data with
information relevant to opinion inference. Such information has previously been
referred to as effect or couched in terms of event-evaluation functors. We
extend                                                  prior theory by making use of
lexical
decomposition
and
present
an
extensive scheme that combines both approaches and thus broadens the set of
inference-relevant predicates. Applying our newly developed guidelines to the
annotation of 726 GermaNet synsets, we achieve a quite high level of
inter-annotator agreement.
