Abstract#==#A support vector classifier was compared to a lexicon-based approach for the
task of detecting the stance categories speculation, contrast and conditional
in English consumer reviews. Around 3,000 training instances were required to
achieve a stable performance of an F-score of 90 for speculation. This
outperformed the lexicon-based approach, for which an F-score of just above 80
was achieved. The machine learning results for the other two categories showed
a lower average (an approximate F-score of 60 for contrast and 70 for
conditional), as well as a larger variance, and were only slightly better than
lexicon matching. Therefore, while machine learning was successful for
detecting speculation, a well-curated lexicon might be a more suitable approach
for detecting contrast and conditional.
