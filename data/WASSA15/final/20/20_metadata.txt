Abstract#==#Psychology research suggests that certain personality traits correlate with
linguistic behavior. This correlation can be effectively modeled with
statistical natural language processing techniques. Prediction accuracy
generally improves with larger data samples, which also allows for more lexical
features.
Most existing work on personality prediction, however, focuses on small samples
and closed-vocabulary investigations. Both factors limit the generality and
statistical power of the results. In this paper, we explore the use of social
media as a resource for large-scale, open-vocabulary personality detection. We
analyze which features are predictive of which personality traits, and present
a novel corpus of 1.2M English tweets annotated with Myers-Briggs personality
type and gender. Our experiments show that social media data can provide
sufficient linguistic evidence to reliably predict two of four personality
dimensions.
