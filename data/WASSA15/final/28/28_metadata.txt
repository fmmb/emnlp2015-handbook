Abstract#==#The form of a thesaurus often restricts its use to word look ups and finding
related words. We present Imagisaurus, an online interactive visualizer
for the Roget's Thesaurus, which not only provides an easy way for word lookups
but
also helps users quickly grasp the nature and size of the thesaurus taxonomy. 
Imagisaurus connects thesaurus entries with a large valence and emotion
association lexicon.  Easy-to-use sliders give the user fine control over
depicting only those categories with the desired strength of association with
positive or negative sentiment, as well as eight basic emotions.  A second
interactive visualization is used to explore the Emotion Lexicon in more
detail.  Both the Roget's Thesaurus and the emotion lexicon have tens of
thousands of entries.  Our visualizers help users better understand these
lexical resources in terms of their make up as a whole. They also provide new
ways to access information through interactive online interfaces.
