Abstract#==#This paper seeks to identify sentiment and non-sentiment bearing hashtags by
combining existing lexical resources. By using a lexicon-based approach, we
achieve 86.3% and 94.5% precision in identifying sentiment and non-sentiment
hashtags, respectively. Moreover, results obtained from both of our
classification models demonstrate that using combined lexical, emotion and word
resources is more effective than using a single resource in identifying the two
types of hashtags.
