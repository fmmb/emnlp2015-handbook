Abstract#==#This paper tackles and evaluates the problem of performing polarity
classification on Twitter over different languages, focusing on English and
Spanish tweets.Three techniques are compared: (1) a monolingual model which
previously knows the language in which the opinion is written, (2) a
monolingual model that acts based on the decision provided by a language
identification tool and (3) a multilingual model trained on a multilingual
dataset that does not need any previous language recognition step. Results show
that multilingual models are more than competitive and are even able to
outperform the monolingual models on some monolingual datasets. As a part of
our evaluation, the paper also introduces the first code-switching corpus with
sentiment labels, showing the robustness of a multilingual approach on this
environment.
