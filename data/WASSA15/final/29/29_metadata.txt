Abstract#==#We offer a critical review of the current state of opinion role extraction
involving opinion verbs.
We argue that neither the currently available lexical resources nor the
manually annotated text corpora are sufficient to appropriately study this
task. We introduce a new corpus focusing on opinion roles of opinion verbs from
the Subjectivity Lexicon and show potential benefits of this corpus.
We also demonstrate that state-of-the-art classifiers perform rather poorly on
this new dataset compared to the standard dataset for the task showing that
there still remains
significant research to be done.
