Abstract#==#We introduce description logics as a means to carry out  sentiment inferences
triggered by some verbs on their semantic roles. Verbs might impose polar
effects on some roles, but also have polar expectations on other roles.
For instance, an entity inherits a positive polarity just by being actor of
some verb (``she succeeds"). More complicated scenarios arise if we take 
subclause embeddings, negation and polarity conflicts into consideration.
Polarity propagation and effect inversion need to be coped with, then. We have
implemented a prototype in OWL covering a substantial subset of our  verb
lexicon covering about 140 German verbs.
