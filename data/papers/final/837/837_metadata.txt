Abstract#==#We present an approach to Arabic automatic diacritization that integrates
syntactic analysis with morphological tagging through improving the prediction
of case and state features.                                   
Our best system increases the accuracy of word diacritization by 2.5% absolute
on all words, and 5.2% absolute on nominals over a state-of-the-art baseline.
Similar increases are shown on the full morphological analysis choice.
