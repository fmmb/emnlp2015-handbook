Abstract#==#We investigate dual decomposition for joint MAP inference of many strings.
Given an arbitrary graphical model, we decompose it into small acyclic
sub-models, whose MAP configurations can be found by finite-state composition
and dynamic programming. We force the solutions of these subproblems to agree
on overlapping variables, by tuning Lagrange multipliers for an adaptively
expanding set of variable-length n-gram count features.
This is the first inference method for arbitrary graphical models over strings
that does not require approximations such as random sampling, message
simplification, or a bound on string length. Provided that the inference method
terminates, it gives a certificate of global optimality (though MAP inference
in our setting is undecidable in general). On our global phonological inference
problems, it always terminates, and achieves more accurate results than
max-product and sum-product loopy belief propagation.
