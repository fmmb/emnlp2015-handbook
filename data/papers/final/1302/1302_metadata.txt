Abstract#==#We describe the WikiQA, a new publicly available set of question and sentence
pairs, collected and annotated for research on open-domain question answering.
Most previous work on answer sentence selection focuses on a dataset created
using the TREC-QA data, which includes editor-generated questions and candidate
answer sentences selected by matching content words in the question. WikiQA
constructed using a more natural process and is more than an order of magnitude
larger than the previous dataset. In addition, the WikiQA dataset also includes
questions for which there are no correct sentences, enabling researchers to
work on answer triggering, a critical component in any QA system. We compare
several systems on the task of answer sentence selection on both datasets and
also describe the performance of a system on the problem of answer triggering
using the WikiQA dataset.
