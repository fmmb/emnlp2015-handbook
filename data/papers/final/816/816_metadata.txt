Abstract#==#We describe a simple and efficient algorithm to disambiguate non-functional
weighted finite state transducers (WFSTs), i.e. to generate a new WFST that
contains a unique, best-scoring path for each hypothesis in the input labels
along with the best output labels. The algorithm uses topological features
combined with a tropical sparse tuple vector semiring. We empirically show that
our algorithm is more efficient than previous work in a PoS-tagging
disambiguation task.  We use our method to rescore very large translation
lattices with a bilingual neural network language model, obtaining gains in
line with the literature.
