Abstract#==#Efficient methods for storing and querying language models are critical for
scaling to large corpora and high Markov orders. In this paper we propose
methods for modeling extremely large corpora without imposing a Markov
condition. At its core, our approach uses a succinct index – a compressed
suffix tree – which provides near optimal compression while supporting
efficient search. We present algorithms for on-the-fly computation of
probabilities under a Kneser-Ney language model. Our technique is exact and
although slower than leading LM toolkits, it shows promising scaling
properties, which we demonstrate through infinite-order modeling over the full
Wikipedia collection.
