Abstract#==#Modeling the entailment relation over sentences is one of the generic problems
of natural language understanding. In order to account for this problem, we
design a theorem prover for Natural Logic, a logic whose terms resemble natural
language expressions. The prover is based on an analytic tableau method and
employs syntactically and semantically motivated schematic rules. Pairing the
prover with a preprocessor, which generates formulas of Natural Logic from
linguistic expressions, results in a proof system for  natural language. It is
shown that the system obtains a comparable accuracy (81%) on the unseen SICK
data while achieving the state-of-the-art precision (98%).
