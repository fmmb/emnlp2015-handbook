Abstract#==#This paper presents a new algorithm to automatically solve algebra word
problems. Our algorithm solves a word problem via analyzing a hypothesis space
containing all possible equation systems generated by assigning the numbers in
the word problem into a set of equation system templates extracted from the
training data. To obtain a robust decision surface, we train a log-linear model
to make the margin between the correct assignments and the false ones as large
as possible. This results in a quadratic programming (QP) problem which can be
efficiently solved. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves 79.7%
accuracy, about 10% higher than the state-of-the-art baseline (Kushman et al.,
2014)
