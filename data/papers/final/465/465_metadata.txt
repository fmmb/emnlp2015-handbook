Abstract#==#Joint models of syntactic and semantic parsing have the potential to improve
performance on both tasks - but to date, the best results have been achieved
with pipelines. We introduce a joint model using CCG, which is motivated by the
close link between CCG syntax and semantics. Semantic roles are recovered by
labelling the deep dependency structures produced by the grammar. Furthermore,
because CCG is lexicalized, we show it is possible to factor the parsing model
over words and introduce a new A* parsing algorithm - which we demonstrate is
faster and more accurate than adaptive supertagging. Our joint model is the
first to substantially improve both syntactic and semantic accuracy over a
comparable pipeline, and also achieves state-of-the-art results for a
non-ensemble semantic role labelling model.
