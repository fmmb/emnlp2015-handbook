Abstract#==#This paper proposes a method for hierarchical phrase-based stream decoding.
  A stream decoder is able to take a continuous stream of tokens as
  input, and segments this stream into word sequences that are translated
  and output as a stream of target word sequences. Phrase-based stream decoding
techniques
  have been shown to be effective as a means of simultaneous interpretation. 
  In this paper we transfer the essence of this idea into the framework of
hierarchical 
  machine translation. The hierarchical decoding framework organizes the
decoding process into a
  chart; this structure is naturally suited to the process of stream decoding,
  leading to an efficient stream decoding algorithm that searches a restricted
  subspace containing only relevant hypotheses.
  Furthermore, the decoder allows more explicit access to the word re-ordering
  process that is of critical importance in decoding while interpreting.
  The decoder was evaluated on TED talk data for English-Spanish and
English-Chinese.
  Our results show that like the phrase-based stream decoder, the hierarchical
  is capable of approaching the performance of the underlying hierarchical
phrase-based
  machine translation decoder, at useful levels of latency. In addition the
hierarchical
  approach appeared to be robust to the difficulties presented by the more
challenging
  English-Chinese task.
