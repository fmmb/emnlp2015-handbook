Abstract#==#Expectation-maximization algorithms, such as those implemented in GIZA++
pervade the field of unsupervised word alignment. However, these algorithms
have a problem of over-fitting, leading to ``garbage collector effects,'' where
rare words tend to be erroneously aligned to untranslated words. This paper
proposes a leave-one-out expectation-maximization algorithm for unsupervised
word alignment to address this problem. The proposed method excludes
information derived from the alignment of a sentence pair from the alignment
models used to align it. This prevents erroneous alignments within a sentence
pair from supporting themselves. Experimental results on Chinese-English and
Japanese-English corpora show that the F$_1$, precision and recall of alignment
were consistently increased by 5.0\% -- 17.2\%, and BLEU scores of end-to-end
translation were raised by 0.03 -- 1.30.  The proposed method also outperformed
$l_0$-normalized GIZA++ and Kneser-Ney smoothed GIZA++.
