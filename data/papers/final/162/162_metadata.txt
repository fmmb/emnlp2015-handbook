Abstract#==#Accurate dependency parsing requires large treebanks, which are only available
for a few languages. 
We propose a method that takes advantage of shared structure across languages
to build a mature parser using less training data. We propose a model for
learning a shared "universal" parser that operates over an inter-lingual
continuous representation of language, along with language-specific mapping
components.
Compared with supervised learning, our methods give a consistent 8-10 %
improvement across several treebanks in low-resource simulations.
