Abstract#==#We present KB-Unify, a novel approach for integrating the output of different
Open Information Extraction systems into a single unified and fully
disambiguated knowledge repository. KB-Unify consists of three main steps: (1)
disambiguation of relation argument pairs via a sense-based vector
representation and a large unified sense inventory; (2) ranking of semantic
relations according to their degree of specificity; (3) cross-resource relation
alignment and merging based on the semantic similarity of domains and ranges.
We tested KB-Unify on a set of four heterogeneous knowledge bases, obtaining
high-quality results. We discuss and provide evaluations at each stage, and
release output and evaluation data for the use and scrutiny of the community.
