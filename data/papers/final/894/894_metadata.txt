Abstract#==#Arabic, Hebrew, and similar languages are typically written without diacritics,
leading to ambiguity and posing a major challenge for core language processing
tasks like speech recognition. Previous approaches to automatic diacritization
employed a variety of machine learning techniques. However, they typically rely
on existing tools like morphological analyzers and therefore cannot be easily
extended to new genres and languages. We develop a recurrent neural network
with long short-term memory layers for predicting diacritics in Arabic text.
Our language-independent approach is trained solely from diacritized text
without relying on external tools. We show experimentally that our model can
rival state-of-the-art methods that have access to additional resources.
