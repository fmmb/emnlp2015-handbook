Abstract#==#This paper presents a bilingual semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation (CWS)
method that leverages the natural segmenting information of English sentences.
The proposed method involves learning three levels of features, namely,
character-level, phrase-level and sentence-level, provided by multiple
sub-models. We use a sub-model of conditional random fields (CRF) to learn
monolingual grammars, a sub-model based on character-based alignment to obtain
explicit segmenting knowledge, and another sub-model based on transliteration
similarity to detect out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Moreover, we propose a
sub-model leveraging neural network to ensure the proper treatment of the
semantic gap and a phrase-based translation sub-model to score the translation
probability of the Chinese segmentation and its corresponding English
sentences. A cascaded log-linear model is employed to combine these features to
segment bilingual unlabeled data, the results of which are used to justify the
original supervised CWS model. The evaluation shows that our method results in
superior results compared with those of the state-of-the-art monolingual and
bilingual semi-supervised models that have been reported in the literature.
