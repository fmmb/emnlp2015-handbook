Abstract#==#We introduce pre-post-editing, possibly the most basic form of interactive
translation, as a touch-based interaction with iteratively improved translation
hypotheses prior to classical post-editing. We report simulated experiments
that yield very large improvements on classical evaluation metrics (up to 21
BLEU) as well as on a parameterized variant of the TER metric that takes into
account the cost of matching/touching tokens, confirming the promising
prospects of the novel translation scenarios offered by our approach.
