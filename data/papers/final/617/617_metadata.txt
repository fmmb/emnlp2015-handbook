Abstract#==#In this work, we build an entity/event-level sentiment analysis system, which
is able to recognize and infer both explicit and implicit sentiments toward
entities and events in the text. We design Probabilistic Soft Logic models that
integrate explicit sentiments, inference rules, and +/-effect event information
(events that positively or negatively affect entities). The experiments show
that the method is able to greatly improve over baseline accuracies in
recognizing entity/event-level sentiments.
