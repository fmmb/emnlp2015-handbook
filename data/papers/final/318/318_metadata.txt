Abstract#==#Monolingual alignment is the task of pairing semantically similar units from
two pieces of text. We report a top-performing supervised aligner that operates
on short text snippets. We employ a large feature set to (1) encode
similarities among semantic units (words and named entities) in context, and
(2) address cooperation and competition for alignment among units in the same
snippet. These features are deployed in a two-stage logistic regression
framework for alignment. On two benchmark data sets, our aligner achieves F1
scores of 92.1% and 88.5%, with statistically significant error reductions of
4.8% and 7.3% over the previous best aligner. It produces top results in
extrinsic evaluation as well.
