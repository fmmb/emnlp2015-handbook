Abstract#==#This paper proposes a tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for
discriminative sentence modeling. Our model leverages either constituency trees
or dependency trees. The tree-based convolution process extracts sentences'
structural features, which are then aggregated by max pooling. Such
architecture allows short propagation paths between the output layer and
underlying feature detectors, enabling effective structural feature learning
and extraction. We evaluate our models on two tasks: sentiment analysis and
question classification. In both experiments, TBCNN outperforms previous
state-of-the-art results, including existing neural networks and dedicated
feature/rule engineering. We also make efforts to visualize the tree-based
convolution process, shedding some light on how our models work.
