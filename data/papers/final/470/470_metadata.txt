Abstract#==#Currently most of state-of-the-art methods
for Chinese word segmentation are
based on supervised learning, whose features
are mostly extracted from a local context.
These methods cannot utilize the long
distance information which is also crucial
for word segmentation. In this paper, we
propose a novel neural network model for
Chinese word segmentation, which adopts
the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural
network to keep the previous important
information in memory cell and avoids
the limit of window size of local context.
Experiments on PKU, MSRA and CTB6
benchmark datasets show that our model
outperforms the previous neural network
models and state-of-the-art methods.
