Abstract#==#In this paper, we consider the task of learning control policies for text-based
games.                                                                               
     

In
these
games,
all
interactions in
the
virtual
world
are
through
text
and the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language barrier makes
such environments challenging for automatic game players. We employ a deep
reinforcement learning framework to jointly learn state representations and
action policies using game rewards as feedback. This framework enables us to
map text descriptions into vector representations that capture the semantics of
the game states. We evaluate our approach on two game worlds, comparing against
baselines using bag-of-words and bag-of-bigrams for state representations.
Our algorithm outperforms the baselines on both worlds demonstrating the
importance of learning expressive representations.
