Abstract#==#Domain adaptation is a challenge for supervised NLP systems because of
expensive and time-consuming manual annotation resources. We present a novel
method
to adapt a supervised coreference resolution system trained on newswire domain
to short narrative stories without retraining the system.
The idea is to perform inference via an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
formulation with the features of narratives adopted  soft constraints. When
testing on the UMIREC and N2 corpora with the-stateof-
the-art Berkeley coreference resolution system trained on OntoNotes, our
inference substantially outperforms the original inference on the CoNLL 2011
metric.
