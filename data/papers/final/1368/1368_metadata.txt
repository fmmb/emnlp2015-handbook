Abstract#==#We introduce an extension to the bag-of-words model for learning words
representations that take into account both syntactic and semantic properties
within language. This is done by employing an attention model, finds within the
contextual words, the words that are relevant for each prediction. The general
intuition of our model is that some words are only relevant for predicting
local context (e.g. function words), while other words are more suited for
determining global context, such as the topic of the document. Experiments
performed on both semantically and syntactically oriented tasks show gains
using our model over the existing bag of words model. Furthermore, compared to
other more sophisticated models, our model scales better as we increase the
size of the context of the model.
