Abstract#==#Traditional approaches to Chinese Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) almost rely on
feature engineering, which means their performances are highly dependent on a
large number of handcrafted features. Even worse, the long-range dependencies
in a sentence can hardly be modeled by these methods. In this paper, we
introduce bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) with long-short-term
memory (LSTM) to capture bidirectional and long-range dependencies in a
sentence with minimal feature engineering. Experimental results on Chinese
Proposition Bank (CPB) show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, our model makes it convenient to introduce heterogeneous
resource, which makes a further improvement to our experimental performance.
