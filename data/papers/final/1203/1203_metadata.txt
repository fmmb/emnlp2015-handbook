Abstract#==#In this study, we consider a summarization method using the document level
similarity
 based on embeddings, or distributed representations of words,
where we assume that an embedding of each word can represent its ``meaning.''
We formalize our task as the problem of maximizing a submodular function
defined by the negative summation of the nearest neighbors' distances on
 embedding distributions,
 each of which represents a set of word embeddings in a document.
We proved the submodularity of our objective function
 and that our problem is asymptotically related to
the KL-divergence between
 the probability density functions that correspond to a document and its
summary in a continuous space.
An experiment using a real dataset demonstrated that our method performed
better than the existing method
 based on the sentence-level similarity.
