Abstract#==#Target entity disambiguation (TED), the task of identifying target entities of
the same domain, has been recognized as a critical step in various important
applications. In this paper, we propose a graph-based model called TremenRank
to collectively identify target entities in short texts given a name list only.
TremenRank propagates trust within the graph, allowing for an arbitrary number
of target entities and texts using inverted index technology. Furthermore, we
design a multi-layer directed graph to assign different trust levels to short
texts for better performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an average gain of 24.8\% in
accuracy and 15.2\% in the F1-measure on three datasets in different domains.
