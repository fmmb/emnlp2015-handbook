Abstract#==#Cross-document co-reference resolution (CCR) computes equivalence classes over
textual mentions denoting the same entity in a document corpus. Named-entity
linking (NEL) disambiguates mentions onto entities present in a knowledge base
(KB) or maps them to null if not present in the KB. Traditionally, CCR and
NEL have been addressed separately. However, such approaches miss out on the
mutual synergies if CCR and NEL were performed jointly.
This paper proposes C3EL, an unsupervised framework combining CCR and NEL for
jointly tackling both problems. C3EL incorporates results from the CCR stage
into NEL, and vice versa: additional global context obtained from CCR improves
the feature space and performance of NEL, while NEL in turn provides distant KB
features for already disambiguated mentions to improve CCR. The CCR and NEL
steps are interleaved in an iterative algorithm that focuses on the
highest-confidence still unresolved mentions in each iteration. Experimental
results on two different corpora, news-centric and web-centric, demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art baselines for both CCR and NEL.
