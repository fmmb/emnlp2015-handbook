Abstract#==#Model combination techniques have consistently shown state-of-the-art
performance across multiple tasks, including syntactic parsing. However, they
dramatically increase runtime and can be difficult to employ in practice. We
demonstrate that applying constituency model combination techniques to n-best
lists instead of n different parsers results in significant parsing accuracy
improvements. Parses are weighted by their probabilities and combined using an
adapted version of Sagae and Lavie (2006). These accuracy gains come with
marginal computational costs and are obtained on top of existing parsing
techniques such as discriminative reranking and self-training, resulting in
state-of-the-art accuracy: 92.6% on WSJ section 23. On out-of-domain corpora,
accuracy is improved by 0.4% on average. We empirically confirm that six
well-known n-best parsers benefit from the proposed methods across six domains.
