Abstract#==#Recently, neural network based dependency parsing has attracted much interest,
which can effectively alleviate the problems of data sparsity and feature
engineering by using the dense features.
However, it is still a challenge problem to sufficiently model the complicated
syntactic and semantic compositions of the dense features in neural network
based methods. 
In this paper, we propose two heterogeneous gated recursive neural networks:
tree structured gated recursive neural network (Tree-GRNN) and directed acyclic
graph structured gated recursive neural network (DAG-GRNN). Then we integrate
them to automatically learn the compositions of the dense features for
transition-based dependency parsing. Specifically, Tree-GRNN models the feature
combinations for the trees in stack, which already have partial dependency
structures. DAG-GRNN models the feature combinations of the nodes whose
dependency relations have not been built yet. Experiment results on two
prevalent benchmark datasets (PTB3 and CTB5) show the effectiveness of our
proposed model.
