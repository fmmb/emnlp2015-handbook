Abstract#==#In this paper, we develop a supervised learning technique that improves noisy
phrase translation scores obtained by phrase table triangulation. 
In particular, we extract word translation distributions from small amounts of
source-target bilingual data (a dictionary or a parallel corpus) with which we
learn to assign better scores to translation candidates obtained by
triangulation.
Our method is able to gain improvement in translation quality on two tasks: 
(1) On Malagasy-to-French translation via English, we use only 1k dictionary
entries to gain +0.5 BLEU over triangulation.
(2) On Spanish-to-French via English we use only 4k sentence pairs to gain +0.7
BLEU over triangulation interpolated with a phrase table extracted from the
same 4k sentence pairs.
