Abstract#==#We present a new method for semantic role labeling in which arguments and
semantic roles are jointly embedded in a shared vector space for a given
predicate. These embeddings belong to a neural network, whose output represents
the potential functions of a graphical model designed for the SRL task. We
consider both local and structured learning methods and obtain state-of-the-art
results on standard PropBank and FrameNet corpora with a straightforward
product-of-experts model. We further show how the model can learn jointly from
PropBank and FrameNet annotations to obtain additional improvements on the
smaller FrameNet dataset.
