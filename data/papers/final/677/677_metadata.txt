Abstract#==#This paper presents a detailed comparative framework for assessing the
usefulness of unsupervised word representations for identifying so-called
implicit discourse relations. Specifically, we compare standard one-hot word
pair representations against low-dimensional ones based on Brown clusters and
word embeddings. We also consider various word vector combination schemes for
deriving discourse segment representations from word vectors, and compare
representations based either on all words or limited to head words. Our main
finding is that denser representations systematically outperform sparser ones
and give state-of-the-art performance or above without the need for additional
hand-crafted features.
