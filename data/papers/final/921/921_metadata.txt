Abstract#==#Events are communicated in natural language with varying degrees of certainty.
For example, if you are "hoping for a raise," it may be somewhat less likely
than if you are "expecting" one. To study these distinctions, we present
scalable, high-quality annotation schemes for event detection and fine-grained
factuality assessment. We find that non-experts, with very little training, can
reliably provide judgments about what events are mentioned and the extent to
which the author thinks they actually happened. We also show how such data
enables the development of regression models for fine-grained scalar factuality
predictions that outperform strong baselines.
