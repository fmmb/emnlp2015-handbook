Abstract#==#In this work, we improve the performance of intra-sentential zero anaphora
resolution in Japanese using a novel method of recognizing subject sharing
relations. In Japanese, a large portion of intra-sentential zero anaphora can
be regarded as subject sharing relations between predicates, that is, the
subject of some predicate is also the unrealized subject of other predicates.
We develop an accurate recognizer of subject sharing relations for pairs of
predicates in a single sentence, and then construct a subject shared predicate
network, which is a set of predicates that are linked by the subject sharing
relations recognized by our recognizer. We finally combine our zero anaphora
resolution method exploiting the subject shared predicate network and a
state-of-the-art ILP-based zero anaphora resolution method. Our combined method
achieved a significant improvement over the the ILP- based method alone on
intra-sentential zero anaphora resolution in Japanese. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly use an independent subject
sharing recognizer in zero anaphora resolution.
