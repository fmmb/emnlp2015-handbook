Abstract#==#This paper proposes a novel approach to generate abstractive summary for
multiple documents by extracting semantic information from texts. The concept
of Basic Semantic Unit (BSU) is defined to describe the semantics of an event
or action. A semantic link network on BSUs is constructed to capture the
semantic information of texts. Summary structure is planned with sentences
generated based on the semantic link network. Experiments demonstrate that the
approach is effective in generating informative, coherent and compact summary.
