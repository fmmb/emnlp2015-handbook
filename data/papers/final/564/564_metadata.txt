Abstract#==#According to the principle of compositionality, 
the meaning of a sentence is computed from 
the meaning of its parts and the way they are 
syntactically combined. In practice, however, 
the syntactic structure is computed by automatic parsers 
which are far-from-perfect and not tuned to the specifics 
of the task. Current recursive neural network (RNN) approaches 
for computing sentence meaning therefore run into a number 
of practical difficulties, including the need to carefully 
select a parser appropriate for the task, deciding how and to 
what extent syntactic context modifies the semantic composition 
function, as well as on how to transform parse trees to conform 
to the branching settings (typically, binary branching) of the RNN. 
This paper introduces a new model, the Forest Convolutional Network, 
that avoids all of these challenges, by taking a parse forest as input, 
rather than a single tree, and by allowing 
arbitrary branching factors. We report improvements over 
the state-of-the-art in sentiment analysis and question classification.
