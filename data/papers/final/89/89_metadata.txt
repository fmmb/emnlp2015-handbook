Abstract#==#Cross-Lingual Learning provides a mechanism to adapt NLP tools available for
label rich languages to achieve similar tasks for label-scarce languages. An
efficient cross-lingual tool significantly reduces the cost and effort required
to manually annotate data. In this paper, we use the Recursive Autoencoder
architecture to develop a Cross Lingual Sentiment Analysis (CLSA) tool using
sentence aligned corpora between a pair of resource rich (English) and resource
poor(Hindi) language. The system is based on the assumption that semantic
similarity between different phrases also implies sentiment similarity in
majority of sentences. The resulting system is then analyzed on a newly
developed Movie Reviews Dataset in Hindi with labels given on a rating scale
and compare performance of our system against existing systems. It is shown
that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art systems for
Sentiment Analysis, especially when labeled data is scarce.
