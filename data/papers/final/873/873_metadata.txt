Abstract#==#Machine Translation (MT) has advanced in recent years to produce better
translations for clients' specific domains, and sophisticated tools allow
professional translators to obtain translations according to their prior edits.
We suggest that MT should be further personalized to the end-user level -- the
receiver or the author of the text -- as done in other applications. As a step
in that direction, we propose a method based on a recommender systems approach
where the user's preferred translation is predicted based on preferences of
similar users. In our experiments, this method outperforms a set of
non-personalized methods, suggesting that user preference information can be
employed to provide better-suited translations for each user.
