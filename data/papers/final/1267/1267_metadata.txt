Abstract#==#Automatic construction of knowledge graphs (KGs) from unstructured text has
received considerable attention in recent research, resulting in the
construction of several KGs with millions of entities (nodes) and facts (edges)
among them. Unfortunately, such KGs tend to be severely sparse in terms of
number of facts known for a given entity, i.e., have low knowledge density. For
example, the NELL KG consists of only 1.34 facts per entity. Unfortunately,
such low knowledge density makes it challenging to use such KGs in real-world
applications. In contrast to best-effort extraction paradigms followed in the
construction of such KGs, in this paper we argue in favor of ENTIty Centric
Expansion (ENTICE), an entity-centric KG population frame- work, to alleviate
the low knowledge density problem in existing KGs. By using ENTICE, we are able
to increase NELLâ€™s knowledge density by a factor of 7.7 at 75.5% accuracy.
Additionally, we are also able to extend the ontology discovering new relations
and entities.
