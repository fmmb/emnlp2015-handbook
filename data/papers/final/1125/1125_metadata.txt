Abstract#==#When building spoken dialogue systems for a new domain, a major bottleneck is
developing a spoken language understanding (SLU) module that handles the new
domainâ€™s terminology and semantic concepts. We propose a statistical SLU
model that generalises to both previously unseen input words and previously
unseen output classes by leveraging unlabelled data. After mapping the
utterance into a vector space, the model exploits the structure of the output
labels by mapping each label to a hyperplane that separates utterances with and
without that label. Both these mappings are initialised with unsupervised word
embeddings, so they can be computed even for words or concepts which
were not in the SLU training data.
