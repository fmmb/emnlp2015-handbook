Abstract#==#We present a new unsupervised mechanism, which ranks word n-grams according to
their multiwordness. It heavily relies on a new uniqueness measure that
computes, based on a distributional thesaurus, how often an n-gram could be
replaced in context by a single-worded term. In addition with a downweighting
mechanism for incomplete terms this forms a new measure called DRUID. Results
show large improvements on two small test sets over competitive baselines. We
demonstrate the scalability of the method to large corpora, and the
independence of the measure of shallow syntactic filtering.
