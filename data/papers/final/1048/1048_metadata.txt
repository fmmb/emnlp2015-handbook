Abstract#==#In this paper we explore a POS tagging application of neural architectures that
can infer word representations from the raw character stream. It relies on two
modelling stages that are jointly learnt: a convolutional network that infers a
word representation directly from the character stream, followed by a
prediction stage. Models are evaluated on a POS and morphological tagging task
for German. Experimental results show that the convolutional network can infer
meaningful word representations, while for the prediction stage, a well
designed and structured strategy allows the model to outperform
state-of-the-art results, without any feature engineering.
