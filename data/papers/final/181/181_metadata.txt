Abstract#==#This paper introduces a novel way to navigate neighborhoods in distributional
semantic models. The approach is based on relative neighborhood graphs, which
uncover the topological structure of local neighborhoods in semantic space.
This has the potential to overcome both the problem with selecting a proper k
in k-NN search, and the problem that a ranked list of neighbors may conflate
several different senses. We provide both qualitative and quantitative results
that support the viability of the proposed method.
