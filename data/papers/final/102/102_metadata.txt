Abstract#==#In recent years, the task of recommending hashtags for microblogs has been
given increasing attention. Various methods have been proposed to study the
problem from different aspects. However, most of the recent studies have not
considered the differences in the types or uses of hashtags. In this paper, we
introduce a novel nonparametric Bayesian method for this task. Based on the
Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM), we incorporate the type of hashtag as
a hidden variable. The results of experiments on the data collected from a real
world microblogging service demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods that do not consider these aspects. By taking these
aspects into consideration, the relative improvement of the proposed method
over the state-of-the-art methods is around 12.2\% in F1- score.
