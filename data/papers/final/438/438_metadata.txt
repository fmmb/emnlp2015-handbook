Abstract#==#We propose a conversion of bilingual sentence pairs and the corresponding word
alignments into novel linear sequences. These are joint translation and
reordering (JTR) uniquely defined sequences, combining interdepending lexical
and alignment dependencies on the word level into a single framework. They are
constructed in a simple manner while capturing multiple alignments and empty
words. JTR sequences can be used to train a variety of models. We investigate
the performances of n-gram models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing,
feed-forward and recurrent neural network architectures when estimated on JTR
sequences, and compare them to the operation sequence model (Durrani et al.,
2013). Evaluations on the IWSLT German-English, WMT German-English and BOLT
Chinese-English tasks show that JTR models improve state-of-the-art
phrase-based systems by up to 2.2 BLEU.
