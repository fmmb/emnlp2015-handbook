Abstract#==#Community question answering, a recent evolution of question answering in the
Web context, allows a user to quickly consult the opinion of a number of people
on a particular topic, thus taking advantage of the wisdom of the crowd. Here
we try to help the user by deciding automatically which answers are good and
which are bad for a given question. In particular, we focus on exploiting the
output structure at the thread level in order to make more consistent global
decisions. More specifically, we exploit the relations between pairs of
comments at any distance in the thread, which we incorporate in a graph-cut and
in an ILP frameworks. The evaluation on the benchmark dataset of SemEval-2015
Task 3 confirms the importance of using thread-level information, which allows
us to improve over the state of the art.
