Abstract#==#We present novel models for domain adaptation based on the neural network joint
model (NNJM). Our models maximize the cross entropy by regularizing the loss
function with respect to in-domain model.
Domain adaptation is carried out by assigning higher weight to 
out-domain sequences that are similar to the in-domain data. In our alternative
model we take a more restrictive approach by additionally penalizing sequences
similar to the out-domain data. Our models achieve better perplexities than the
baseline NNJM models and give improvements of up to 0.5 and 0.6 BLEU points in
Arabic-to-English and English-to-German language pairs, on a standard task of
translating TED talks.
