Abstract#==#Wikipedia is the largest collection of encyclopedic data ever written in the
history of humanity. Thanks to its coverage and its availability in
machine-readable format, it has become a primary resource for large-scale
research in historical and cultural studies. In this work, we focus on the
subset of pages describing persons, and we investigate the task of recognizing
biographical sections from them: given a person's page, we identify the list of
sections where information about her/his life is present. We model this as a
sequence classification problem, and propose a supervised setting, in which the
training data are acquired automatically. Besides, we show that six simple
features extracted only from the section titles are very informative and yield
good results well above a strong baseline.
