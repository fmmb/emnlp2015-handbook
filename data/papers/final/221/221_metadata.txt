Abstract#==#Linking named mentions detected in a source document to an existing knowledge
base provides disambiguated entity referents for the mentions. This allows
better document analysis, knowledge extraction and knowledge base population.
Most of the previous research extensively exploited the linguistic features of
the source documents in a supervised or semi-supervised way. These systems
therefore cannot be easily applied to a new language or domain. In this paper,
we present a novel unsupervised algorithm named Quantified Collective
Validation that avoids excessive linguistic analysis on the source documents
and fully leverages the knowledge base structure for the entity linking task.
We show our approach achieves state-of-the-art English entity linking
performance and demonstrate successful deployment in a new language (Chinese)
and two new domains (Biomedical and Earth Science). All the experiment datasets
and system demonstration are available at
