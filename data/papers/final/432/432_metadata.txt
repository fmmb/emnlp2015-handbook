Abstract#==#Social media is a rich source of up-to-date information about events such as
incidents. The sheer amount of available information makes machine learning
approaches a necessity to process this information further. This learning
problem is often concerned with regionally restricted datasets such as data
from only one city. Because social media data such as tweets varies
considerably across different cities, the training of efficient models requires
labeling data from each city of interest, which is costly and time consuming. 

In this paper, we investigate which features are most suitable for training
generalizable models, i.e., models that show good performance across different
datasets. We re-implemented the most popular features from the state of the art
in addition to other novel approaches, and evaluated them on data from ten
different cities. We show that many sophisticated features are not necessarily
valuable for training a generalized model and are outperformed by classic
features such as plain word-n-grams and character-n-grams.
