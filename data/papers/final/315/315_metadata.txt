Abstract#==#Humor is an essential component in personal communication. How to create
computational models to discover the structure behind humor, recognize humor
and even extract humor anchors remains a challenge. In this work, we first
identify several semantic structures behind humor and design sets of features
for each theory, and next employ a computational approach to recognize humor.
Furthermore, we develop a simple and effective method to extract anchors that
enable humor in a sentence. Experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate
that our humor recognizer is effective in automatically distinguishing between
humorous and non-humorous texts and our extracted humor anchors correlate quite
well with human annotations.
