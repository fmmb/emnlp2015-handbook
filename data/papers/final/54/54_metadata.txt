Abstract#==#We present a novel method for the cross-lingual
transfer of dependency parsers.
Our goal is to induce a dependency parser
in a target language of interest without
any direct supervision: instead we assume
access to parallel translations between
the target and one or more source
languages, and to supervised parsers in
the source language(s). Our key contributions
are to show the utility of dense projected
structures when training the target
language parser, and to introduce a novel
learning algorithm that makes use of dense
structures. Results on several languages
show an absolute improvement of 5.51%
in average dependency accuracy over the
state-of-the-art method of (Ma and Xia,
2014). Our average dependency accuracy
of 82.18% compares favourably to the accuracy
of fully supervised methods.
