Abstract#==#This work focuses on the task of finding latent vector representations of the
words in a corpus. In particular, we address the issue of what to do when there
are multiple languages in the corpus. Prior work has, among other techniques,
used canonical correlation analysis to project pre-trained vectors in two
languages into a common space. We propose a simple and scalable method that is
inspired by the notion that the learned vector representations should be
invariant to translation between languages. We show empirically that our method
outperforms prior work on multilingual tasks, matches the performance of prior
work on monolingual tasks, and scales linearly with the size of the input data
(and thus the number of languages being embedded).
