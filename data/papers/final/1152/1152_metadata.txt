Abstract#==#We outline a learning framework that aims at identifying useful contextual cues
for knowledge-based word sense disambiguation. The usefulness of
individual context words is evaluated based on diverse lexico-statistical and
syntactic
information, as well as simple word distance. Experiments using two different
knowledge-based methods and benchmark datasets show signiÔ¨Åcant improvements
due to context modeling, beating the conventional window-based approach.
