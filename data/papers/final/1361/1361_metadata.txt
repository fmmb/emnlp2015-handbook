Abstract#==#In this paper we study the identification and verification of simple claims
about statistical properties, e.g. claims about the population or the inflation
rate of a country. We show that this problem is similar to extracting numerical
information from text and following recent work, instead of annotating data for
each property of interest in order to learn supervised models, we develop a
distantly supervised baseline approach using a knowledge base and raw text. In
experiments on 16 statistical properties about countries from Freebase we show
that our approach  identifies simple statistical claims about properties with
60% precision, while it is able to verify these claims without requiring any
explicit supervision for either tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach as
a statistical property extractor and we show it achieves 0.11 mean absolute
percentage error.
