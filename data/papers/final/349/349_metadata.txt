Abstract#==#This paper introduces GEOS, the first automated system to solve unaltered SAT
geometry
questions by combining text understanding and diagram interpretation.
We model the problem of understanding geometry questions as submodular
optimization,
and identify a formal problem description likely to be compatible with both the
question text and diagram.
GEOS then feeds the description to a geometric solver that attempts to
determine the correct answer.
In our experiments, GEOS achieves a 49% score on official SAT questions, and a
score of 61% on practice questions.
Finally, we show that by integrating textual and visual information, GEOS
boosts the accuracy of dependency and semantic parsing of the question text.
