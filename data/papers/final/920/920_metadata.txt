Abstract#==#In this paper we analyze the performance of different composition models on a
large dataset of German compound nouns. Given a vector space model for the
German language, we try to reconstruct the observed representation (the
corpus-estimated vector) of a compound by composing the observed
representations of its two immediate constituents. We explore the composition
models proposed in the literature and also present a new, simple model that
achieves the best performance on our dataset.
