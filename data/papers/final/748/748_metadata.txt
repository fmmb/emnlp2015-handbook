Abstract#==#Many discourse relations are explicitly marked with discourse connectives, and
these examples could potentially serve as a plentiful source of training data
for recognizing implicit discourse relations. However, there are important
linguistic differences between explicit and implicit discourse relations, which
limit the accuracy of such an approach. We account for these differences by
applying techniques from domain adaptation, treating implicitly and
explicitly-marked discourse relations as separate domains. The distribution of
surface features varies across these two domains, so we apply a marginalized
denoising autoencoder to induce a dense, domain-general representation. The
label distribution is also domain-specific, so we apply a resampling technique
that is similar to instance weighting. In combination with a set of
automatically-labeled data, these improvements eliminate more than 80\% of the
transfer loss incurred by training an implicit discourse relation classifier on
explicitly-marked discourse relations.
