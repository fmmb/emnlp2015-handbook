Abstract#==#The task of cross-language document summarization is to create a summary in a
target language from documents in a different source language. Previous methods
only involve direct  extraction of automatically translated sentences from the
original documents. Inspired by phrase-based machine translation, we propose a
phrase-based model to simultaneously perform sentence scoring, extraction and
compression. We design a greedy algorithm to approximately optimize the score
function. Experimental results show that our methods outperform the
state-of-the-art extractive systems while maintaining similar grammatical
quality.
