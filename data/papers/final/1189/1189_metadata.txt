Abstract#==#We present experiments with generative models for linearization of unordered
labeled syntactic dependency trees (Belz et al., 2011; Rajkumar and White,
2014). Our linearization models are derived from generative models for
dependency structure (Eisner, 1996). We present a series of generative
dependency models designed to capture successively more information about
ordering constraints among sister dependents. We give a dynamic programming
algorithm for computing the conditional probability of word orders given tree
structures under these models. The models are tested on corpora of 11 languages
using test-set likelihood, and human ratings for generated forms are collected
for English. Our models benefit from representing local order constraints among
sisters and from backing off to less sparse distributions, including
distributions not conditioned on the head.
