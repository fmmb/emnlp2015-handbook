Abstract#==#This paper discusses the use of factorization techniques in distributional
semantic models. We focus on a method for redistributing the weight of latent
variables, which have previously been shown to improve the performance of
distributional semantic models. However, this result has not been replicated
and remains poorly understood. We refine the method, and provide additional
theoretical justification, as well as empirical results that demonstrate the
viability of the proposed approach.
