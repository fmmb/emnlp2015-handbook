Abstract#==#We compare the multinomial i-vector framework from the speech community with
LDA, SAGE, and LSA as feature learners for topic ID on multinomial speech and
text data. We also compare the learned representations in their ability to
discover topics, quantified by distributional similarity to gold-standard
topics and by human interpretability. We find that topic ID and topic discovery
are competing objectives. We argue that LSA and i-vectors should be more widely
considered by the text processing community as pre-processing steps for
downstream tasks, and also speculate about speech processing tasks that could
benefit from more interpretable representations like SAGE.
