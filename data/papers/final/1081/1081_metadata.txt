Abstract#==#We present an approach for extractive single-document summarization. Our
approach is based on a weighted graphical representation of documents obtained
by topic modeling. We optimize importance, coherence and non-redundancy
simultaneously using ILP. We compare ROUGE scores of our system with
state-of-the-art results on scientific articles from PLOS
Medicine and on DUC 2002 data. Human judges evaluate the coherence of summaries
generated by our system in comparision to two baselines. Our approach obtains
competitive performance.
