Abstract#==#We propose a method to detect hidden data in English text. We target a system
previously thought secure, which hides messages in tweets. The method brings
ideas from image steganalysis into the linguistic domain, including the
training of a feature-rich model for detection. To identify Twitter users
guilty of steganography, we aggregate evidence; a first, in any domain. We test
our system on a set of 1M steganographic tweets, and show it to be effective.
