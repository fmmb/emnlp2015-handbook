Abstract#==#Distributional methods have proven to excel at capturing fuzzy, graded
  aspects of meaning (Italy is more
  similar to Spain than to Germany). In contrast, it is
  difficult to extract the values of more specific attributes of word
  referents from distributional representations, attributes of the
  kind typically found in structured knowledge bases (Italy has
  60 million inhabitants).  In this paper, we pursue the
  hypothesis that distributional vectors also implicitly encode
  referential attributes. 

  We show that a standard supervised
  regression model is in fact sufficient to retrieve such
  attributes to a reasonable degree of accuracy:
  When evaluated on the prediction of both categorical and
  numeric attributes of countries and cities,
  the model consistently reduces baseline error by 30%,
  and is not far from the upper bound.
  Further analysis suggests that
  our model is able to ``objectify''
  distributional representations for entities, anchoring
  them more firmly in the external world in measurable ways.
