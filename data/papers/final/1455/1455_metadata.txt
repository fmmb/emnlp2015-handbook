Abstract#==#Language use is known to be influenced by personality traits as well as by
socio-demographic characteristics such as age or mother tongue. As a result, it
is possible to automatically identify these traits of the author from her
texts. It has recently been shown that knowledge of such dimensions can improve
performance in NLP tasks such as topic and sentiment modeling. We posit that
machine translation is another application that should be personalized. In
order to motivate this, we explore whether translation preserves demographic
and psychometric traits. We show that, largely, both translation of the source 
training data into the target language, and the target test data into the
source language has a detrimental effect on the accuracy of predicting author
traits. We argue that this supports the need for personal and personality-aware
machine translation models.
