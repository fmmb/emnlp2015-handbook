Abstract#==#We demonstrate the advantage of specializing semantic word embeddings for
either similarity or relatedness. We compare two variants of retrofitting and a
joint-learning approach, and find that all three yield specialized semantic
spaces that capture human intuitions regarding similarity and relatedness
better than unspecialized spaces. We also show that using specialized spaces in
NLP tasks and applications leads to clear improvements, for document
classification and synonym selection, which rely on either similarity or
relatedness but not both.
