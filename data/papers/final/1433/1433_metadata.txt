Abstract#==#Transition-based dependency parsers usually use transition systems that
monotonically extend partial parse states until they identify a complete parse
tree. Honnibal et al. (2013) showed that greedy parsing accuracy can be
improved by adding additional non-monotonic transitions that permit the
parser to “repair” earlier parsing mistakes by “over-writing” earlier
parsing decisions. This increases the size of the set of complete parse trees
that each partial parse state can derive, enabling such a parser to escape the
“garden paths” that can trap monotonic greedy transition-based dependency
parsers.

We describe a new set of non-monotonic transitions that permits a partial parse
state to derive a larger set of completed parse trees than previous work, which
allows our parser to escape from a larger set of garden paths. A parser with
our new non- monotonic transition system has 91.85% directed attachment
accuracy, an improvement of 0.6% over a comparable parser using the standard
monotonic arc-eager transitions.
