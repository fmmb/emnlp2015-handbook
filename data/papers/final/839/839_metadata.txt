Abstract#==#We investigate a combination of a traditional linear sparse feature model
and a multi-layer neural network model for deterministic transition-based
dependency parsing,
by integrating the sparse features into the neural model.
Correlations are drawn between the hybrid model and previous work on
integrating word embedding features into a discrete linear model.
By analyzing the results of various parsers on web-domain parsing,
we show that the integrated model is a better way to combine traditional and
embedding features compared with previous methods.
