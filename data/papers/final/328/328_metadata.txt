Abstract#==#In hierarchical phrase-based machine translation, a rule table is automatically
learned by heuristically extracting synchronous rules from a parallel corpus.
As a result, spuriously many rules are extracted which may be composed of
various incorrect rules.
The larger rule table incurs more run time for decoding and may result in lower
translation quality.
To resolve the problems, we propose a hierarchical back-off model for Hiero
grammar, an instance of a synchronous context free grammar (SCFG), on the basis
of the hierarchical Pitman-Yor process.
The model can extract a compact rule and phrase table without resorting to any
heuristics by hierarchically backing off to smaller phrases under SCFG.
Inference is efficiently carried out using two-step synchronous parsing of Xiao
et al., (2012) combined with slice sampling.
In our experiments, the proposed model achieved higher or at least comparable
translation quality against a previous Bayesian model on various language
pairs; German/French/Spanish/Japanese-English.
When compared against heuristic models, our model achieved comparable
translation quality on a full size German-English language pair in Europarl v7
corpus with significantly smaller grammar size; less than 10% of that for
heuristic model.
