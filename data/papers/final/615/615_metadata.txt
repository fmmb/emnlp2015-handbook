Abstract#==#This paper describes an alignment-based model for interpreting natural language
instructions in context. We approach instruction following as a search over
plans, scoring sequences of actions conditioned on structured observations of
text and the environment. By explicitly modeling both the low-level
compositional structure of individual actions and the high-level structure of
full plans, we are able to learn both grounded representations of sentence
meaning and pragmatic constraints on interpretation. To demonstrate the
modelâ€™s flexibility, we apply it to a diverse set of benchmark tasks. On
every task, we outperform strong task-specific baselines, and achieve several
new state-of-the-art results.
