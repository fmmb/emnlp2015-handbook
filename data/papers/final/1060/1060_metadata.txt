Abstract#==#Predicting the success of referring expressions (RE) is vital for real-world
applications such as navigation systems. Traditionally, research has focused on
studying Referring Expression Generation (REG) in virtual, controlled
environments. In this paper, we describe a novel study of spatial references
from real scenes rather than virtual. First, we investigate how humans describe
objects in open, uncontrolled scenarios and compare our findings to those
reported in virtual environments. We show that REs in real-world scenarios
differ significantly to those in virtual worlds. Second, we propose a novel
approach to quantifying image complexity when complete annotations are not
present (e.g. due to poor object recognition capabitlities), and third, we
present a model for success prediction of REs for objects in real scenes.
Finally, we discuss implications for Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems
and future directions.
