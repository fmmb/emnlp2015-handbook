Abstract#==#The most successful approaches to extractive text summarization seek
to maximize bigram coverage subject to a budget constraint.
In this work, we propose instead to maximize semantic volume. 
We embed each sentence in a semantic space and construct a 
summary by choosing a subset of sentences whose convex hull maximizes volume
in that space.
We provide a greedy algorithm based on the Gram-Schmidt process to efficiently
perform volume maximization.
Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art summarization approaches on
benchmark datasets.
