Abstract#==#Performing link prediction in Knowledge Bases (KBs) with embedding-based
models, like with the model TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) which represents
relationships as translations in the embedding space, have shown promising
results in recent years. Most of these works focused on modeling single
relationships and hence do not take full advantage of the graph structure of
KBs. In this paper, we propose an extension of TransE that learns to explicitly
model composition of relationships via the addition of their corresponding
translation vectors. We show empirically that this allows to improve
performance for predicting single relationships as well as compositions of
pairs of them.
