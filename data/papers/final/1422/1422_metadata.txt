Abstract#==#In the last two years, there has been a surge of word embedding
algorithms and research on them.  However, evaluation has
mostly been carried out on a narrow set of tasks, mainly word
similarity/relatedness and word relation similarity and on a single
language, namely English.

We propose an approach to evaluate embeddings on a variety of
languages that also yields insights into the structure of the
embedding space by investigating how well word embeddings cluster
along different syntactic features.

We show that all embedding approaches behave similarly in this task,
with dependency-based embeddings performing best. This effect is even more
pronounced when generating low dimensional embeddings.
