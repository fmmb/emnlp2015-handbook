Abstract#==#We propose a grammar induction technique for AMR semantic parsing. While
previous grammar induction techniques were designed to re-learn a new parser
for each target application, the recently annotated AMR Bank provides a unique
opportunity to induce a single model for understanding broad-coverage newswire
text and support a wide range of applications. We present a new model that
combines CCG parsing to recover compositional aspects of meaning and a factor
graph to model non-compositional phenomena, such as anaphoric dependencies. Our
approach achieves 66.2 Smatch F1 score on the AMR bank, significantly
outperforming the previous state of the art.
