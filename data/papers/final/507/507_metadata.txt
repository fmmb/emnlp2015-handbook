Abstract#==#We use character-based statistical machine translation in order to correct user
search queries in the e-commerce domain. The training data is automatically
extracted from event logs where users re-issue their search queries with
potentially corrected spelling within the same session. We show results on a
test set which was annotated by humans and compare against online
autocorrection capabilities of three additional web sites. Overall, the methods
presented in this paper outperform fully productized spellchecking and
autocorrection services in terms of accuracy and F1 score. We also propose
novel evaluation steps based on retrieved search results of the corrected
queries in terms of quantity and relevance.
