Abstract#==#Because of polysemy, distant labeling for information extraction leads to noisy
training data. We describe a procedure for reducing this noise by using label
propagation on a graph in which the nodes are entity mentions, and mentions are
coupled when they occur in coordinate list structures. We show that this
labeling approach leads to good performance even when off-the-shelf classifiers
are used on the distantly-labeled data.
