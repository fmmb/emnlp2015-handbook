Abstract#==#This paper proposes a novel hierarchical recurrent neural network language
model (HRNNLM) for document modeling. After establishing a RNN to capture the
coherence between sentences in a document, HRNNLM integrates it as the sentence
history information into the word level RNN to predict the word sequence with
cross-sentence contextual information. A two-step training approach is
designed, in which sentence-level and word-level language models are
approximated for the convergence in a pipeline style. Examined by the standard
sentence ordering scenario, HRNNLM is proved for its better accuracy in
modeling the sentence coherence. And at the word level, experimental results
also indicate a significant lower model perplexity, followed by a practical
better translation result when applied to a Chinese-English document
translation reranking task.
