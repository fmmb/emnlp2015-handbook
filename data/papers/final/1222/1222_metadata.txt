Abstract#==#We present the novel  features trained with a deep neural network for Machine
Translation (MT) Quality Estimation (QE). The features are learned with a
Continuous Space Language Model (CSLM) by estimating the probabilities of the
source and target segments. These new features along with other available MT
system-independent features  are investigated on series of  datasets with
various  quality labels for QE including Post Editing Effort (PEE) , Human
Translation Edit Rate (HTER), Post Editing Time (PET) and METEOR score. The
results show the significant improvements in predictions over the baseline as
well as systems trained on previously available features set for all WMT QE
tasks. More notably,  the addition of newly proposed features beat previous
best systems by a significant margin on official WMT12 and WMT14 post editing
effort prediction tasks.
