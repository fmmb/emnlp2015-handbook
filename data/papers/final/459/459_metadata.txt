Abstract#==#Twitter is often used in quantitative studies that identify
geographically-preferred topics, writing styles, and entities. These studies
rely on either GPS coordinates attached to individual messages, or on the
user-supplied location field in each profile.
In this paper, we compare these data acquisition techniques and quantify the
biases that they introduce; we also measure their effects on linguistic
analysis and text-based geolocation. GPS-tagging and self-reported locations
yield measurably different corpora, and these linguistic differences are
partially attributable to differences in dataset composition by age and gender.
Using a latent variable model to induce age and gender, we show how these
demographic variables interact with geography to affect language use. We also
show that the accuracy of text-based geolocation varies with population
demographics, giving the best results for men above the age of 40.
