Abstract#==#We present novel experiments in modeling
the rise and fall of story characteristics
within narrative, leading up to the Most
Reportable Event (MRE), the compelling
event that is the nucleus of the story. We
construct a corpus of personal narratives
from the bulletin board website Reddit,
using the organization of Reddit content
into topic-specific communities to automatically
identify narratives. Leveraging
the structure of Reddit comment threads,
we automatically label a large dataset of
narratives. We present a change-based
model of narrative that tracks changes in
formality, affect, and other characteristics
over the course of a story, and we use
this model in distant supervision and self-training
experiments that achieve significant improvements over the baselines at
the task of identifying MREs.
