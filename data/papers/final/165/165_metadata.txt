Abstract#==#Two problems arise when using distant supervision for relation extraction.
First, in this method, an already existing knowledge base is heuristically
aligned to texts, and the alignment results are treated as labeled data. 
However, the heuristic alignment can fail, resulting in wrong label problem. In
addition, in previous approaches, statistical models have typically been
applied to ad hoc features. The noise that originates from the feature
extraction process can cause poor performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel model dubbed the Piecewise Convolutional
Neural Networks (PCNNs) with multi-instance learning to address these two
problems. To solve the first problem, distant supervised relation extraction is
treated as a multi-instance problem in which the uncertainty of instance labels
is taken into account. To address the latter problem, we avoid feature
engineering and instead adopt convolutional architecture with piecewise max
pooling to automatically learn relevant features. Experiments show that our
method is effective and outperforms several competitive baseline methods.
