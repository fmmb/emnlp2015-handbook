Abstract#==#We propose a novel framework for improving a word segmenter using information
acquired from symbol grounding.
We generate a term dictionary in three steps: generating a
pseudo-stochastically segmented corpus, building a symbol grounding model to
enumerate word candidates, and filtering them according to the grounding
scores.
We applied our method to game records of Japanese chess with commentaries.
The experimental results show that the accuracy of a word segmenter can be
improved by incorporating the generated dictionary.
