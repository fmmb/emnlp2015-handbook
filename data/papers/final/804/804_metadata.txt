Abstract#==#fast_align is a simple, fast, and efficient approach for word alignment based
on the IBM model 2. fast_align performs well for language pairs with relatively
similar word orders; however, it does not perform well for language pairs with
drastically different word orders. We propose a segmenting-reversing reordering
process to solve this problem by alternately applying fast_align and reordering
source sentences during training. Experimental results with Japanese-English
translation demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the performance of
fast_align significantly without the loss of efficiency. Experiments using
other languages are also reported.
