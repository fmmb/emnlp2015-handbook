Abstract#==#As a key representation model of knowledge,
ontology has been widely used in
a lot of NLP related tasks, such as semantic
parsing, information extraction and
text mining etc. In this paper, we study
the task of ontology matching, which concentrates
on finding semantically related
entities between different ontologies that
describe the same domain, to solve the
semantic heterogeneity problem. Previous
works exploit different kinds of descriptions
of an entity in ontology directly
and separately to find the correspondences
without considering the higher level correlations
between the descriptions. Besides,
the structural information of ontology
havenâ€™t been utilized adequately
for ontology matching. We propose in
this paper an ontology matching approach,
named ERSOM, which mainly includes
an unsupervised representation learning
method based on the deep neural networks
to learn the general representation
of the entities and an iterative similarity
propagation method that takes advantage
of more abundant structure information
of the ontology to discover more mappings.
