Abstract#==#Recently, neural network based sentence modeling methods have achieved great
progress. Among these methods, the recursive neural networks (RecNNs) can
effectively model the combination of the words in sentence. However, RecNNs
need a given external topological structure, like syntactic tree.
In this paper, we propose a gated recursive neural
network (GRNN) to model sentences, which employs a full binary tree (FBT)
structure to control the combinations in recursive structure. By introducing
two kinds of gates, our model can better model the complicated combinations of
features. Experiments on three text classification datasets show the
effectiveness of our model.
