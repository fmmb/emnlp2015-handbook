Abstract#==#In this paper we propose a framework to improve word segmentation accuracy
using
input method logs.  An input method is software used to type sentences in
languages
which have far more characters than the number of keys on a keyboard.  The main
contributions of this paper are: 1) an input method server that proposes word
candidates which are not included in the vocabulary, 2) a publicly usable input
method that logs user behavior (like typing and selection of word candidates),
and 3)
a method for improving word segmentation by using these logs.  We conducted
word
segmentation experiments on tweets from Twitter, and showed that our method
improves
accuracy in this domain.  Our method itself is domain-independent and only
needs logs
from the target domain.
