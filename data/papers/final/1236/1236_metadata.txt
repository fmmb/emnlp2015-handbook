Abstract#==#Research on modeling time series text corpora has typically focused on
predicting what text will come next, but less well studied is predicting when
the next text event will occur. In this paper we address the latter case,
framed as modeling continuous inter-arrival times under a log-Gaussian Cox
process, a form of inhomogeneous Poisson process which captures the varying
rate at which the tweets arrive over time. In an application to rumour modeling
of tweets surrounding the 2014 Ferguson riots, we show how inter-arrival times
between tweets can be accurately predicted, and that incorporating textual
features further improves predictions.
