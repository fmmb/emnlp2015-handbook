Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a paraphrasing model to address the task of system
combination for machine translation. We dynamically learn hierarchical
paraphrases from target hypotheses and form a synchronous context-free grammar
to guide a series of transformations of target hypotheses into fused
translations. The model is able to exploit phrasal and structural
system-weighted consensus and also to utilize existing information about word
ordering present in the target hypotheses. In addition, to consider a diverse
set of plausible fused translations, we develop a hybrid combination
architecture, where we paraphrase every target hypothesis using different
fusing techniques to obtain fused translations for each target, and then make
the final selection among all fused translations. Our experimental results show
that our approach can achieve a significant improvement over combination
baselines.
