Abstract#==#Distributed word representations capture relational similarities by means of
vector arithmetics, giving high accuracies on analogy detection. We empirically
investigate the use of syntactic dependencies on improving analogy detection
based on distributed word representations, showing that a dependency-based
embeddings does not perform better than an ngram-based embeddings, but
dependency structures can be used to improve analogy detection by filtering
candidates. In addition, we show that distributed representations of dependency
structure can be used for measuring relational similarities, thereby help
analogy mining.
