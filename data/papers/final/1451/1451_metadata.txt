Abstract#==#In syntax-based machine translation, rule selection is the task of choosing
the correct target side of a translation rule among rules with the same source
side.
We define a discriminative rule selection model for systems that have syntactic
annotation on the target language side (string-to-tree).
This is a new and clean way to integrate soft source syntactic constraints into
string-to-tree systems as features of the rule selection model. 
We release our implementation as part of Moses.
