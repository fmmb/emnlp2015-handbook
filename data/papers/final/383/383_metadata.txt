Abstract#==#Learning semantic representations and tree structures of bilingual phrases is
beneficial for statistical machine translation. In this paper, we propose a new
neural
network model called Bilingual Correspondence Recursive Autoencoder (BCorrRAE)
to model
bilingual phrases in translation. We incorporate word alignments into BCorrRAE
to allow
it freely access bilingual constraints at different levels. BCorrRAE minimizes
a joint
objective on the combination of a recursive autoencoder reconstruction error, a
structural
alignment consistency error and a cross-lingual reconstruction error so as to
not only
generate alignment-consistent phrase structures, but also capture different
levels of
semantic relations within bilingual phrases. In order to examine the
effectiveness of
BCorrRAE, we incorporate both semantic and structural similarity features built
on bilingual phrase representations and tree structures learned by BCorrRAE
into a state-of-the-art SMT system. Experiments on NIST Chinese-English test
sets show that our model
achieves a substantial improvement of up to 1.55 BLEU points over the baseline.
