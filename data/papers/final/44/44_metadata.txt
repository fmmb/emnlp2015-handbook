Abstract#==#We present a novel framework of system combination for multi-document
summarization. For each input set (input), we generate candidate summaries by
combining whole sentences from the summaries generated by different systems. We
show that the oracle among these candidates is much better than the summaries
that we have combined. We then present a supervised model to select among the
candidates. The model relies on a rich set of features that capture content
importance from different perspectives. Our model performs better than the
systems that we combined based on manual and automatic evaluations. We also
achieve very competitive performance on six DUC/TAC datasets, comparable to the
state-of-the-art on most datasets.
