Abstract#==#There are two main types of word representations: low-dimensional embeddings
and high-dimensional distributional vectors, in which each dimension
corresponds to a context word. In this paper, we initialize an
embedding-learning model with distributional vectors. Evaluation on word
similarity shows that this initialization significantly increases the quality
of embeddings for rare words.
