Abstract#==#Analyzing arguments in user-generated Web discourse has recently gained
attention in argumentation mining, an evolving field of NLP. Current
approaches, which employ fully-supervised machine learning, are usually domain
dependent and suffer from the lack of large and diverse annotated corpora.
However, annotating arguments in discourse is costly, error-prone, and highly
context-dependent. We asked whether leveraging unlabeled data in a
semi-supervised manner can boost the performance of argument component
identification and to which extent is the approach independent of domain and
register. We propose novel features that exploit clustering of unlabeled data
from debate portals based on a word embeddings representation. Using these
features, we significantly outperform several baselines in the
cross-validation, cross-domain, and cross-register evaluation scenarios.
