Abstract#==#Storyline detection from news articles aims at summarizing events described
under a certain news topic and revealing how those events evolve over time. It
is a difficult task because it requires first the detection of events from news
articles published in different time periods and then the construction of
storylines by linking events into coherent news stories. Moreover, each
storyline has different hierarchical structures which are dependent across
epochs. Existing approaches often ignore the dependency of hierarchical
structures in storyline generation. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised
Bayesian model, called dynamic storyline detection model, to extract structured
representations and evolution patterns of storylines. The proposed model is
evaluated on a large scale news corpus. Experimental results show that our
proposed model outperforms several baseline approaches.
