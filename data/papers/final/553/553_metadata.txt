Abstract#==#Compositional embedding models build a representation (or embedding) for a
linguistic structure based on its component word embeddings. We propose a
Feature-rich Compositional Embedding Model (FCM) for relation extraction that
is expressive, generalizes to new domains, and is easy-to-implement. The key
idea is to combine both (unlexicalized) hand-crafted features with learned
word embeddings. The model is able to directly tackle the difficulties met by
traditional compositional embeddings models, such as handling arbitrary types
of sentence annotations and utilizing global information for composition. We
test the proposed model on two relation extraction tasks, and demonstrate that
our model outperforms both previous compositional models and traditional
feature rich models on the ACE 2005 relation extraction task, and the SemEval
2010 relation classification task. The combination of our model and a
log-linear classifier with hand-crafted features gives state-of-the-art
results. We made our implementation available for general use.
