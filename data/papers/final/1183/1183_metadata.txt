Abstract#==#Learning to determine when the time-varying facts of a Knowledge Base (KB) have
to be updated is a challenging task. We propose to learn state changing verbs
from Wikipedia edit history. When a state-changing event, such as a marriage or
death, happens to an entity, the infobox on the entity’s Wikipedia page
usually gets updated. At the same time, the article text may be updated with
verbs either being added or deleted to reflect the changes made to the infobox.
We use Wikipedia edit history to distantly supervise a method for automatically
learning verbs and state changes. Additionally, our method uses constraints to
effectively map verbs to infobox changes. We observe in our experiments that
when state-changing verbs are added or deleted from an entity’s Wikipedia
page text, we can predict the entity’s infobox updates with 88% precision and
76% recall. One compelling application of our verbs is to incorporate them as
triggers in methods for updating existing KBs, which are currently mostly
static.
