Abstract#==#In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of the relationship
between a person’s traits and his/her brand preferences. In our analysis, we
included a large number of character traits such as personality, personal
values and individual needs. These trait features were obtained from both a
psychometric survey and automated social media analytics. We also included an
extensive set of brand names from diverse product categories. From this
analysis, we want to shed some light on (1) whether it is possible to use
personal traits to infer an individual’s brand preferences (2) whether the
trait features automatically inferred from social media are good proxies for
the ground truth character traits in brand preference prediction.
