Abstract#==#Unsupervisedly learned word vectors have proven to provide exceptionally
effective features in many NLP tasks. Most common intrinsic evaluations of
vector quality measure correlation with similarity judgments. However, these
often correlate poorly with how well the learned representations perform as
features in downstream evaluation tasks. We present QVEC —a computationally
inexpensive intrinsic evaluation measure of the quality of word embeddings
based on alignment to a matrix of features extracted from manually crafted
lexical resources—that obtains strong correlation with performance of the
vectors in a battery of downstream semantic evaluation tasks.
