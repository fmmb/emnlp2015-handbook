Abstract#==#Modeling sentence similarity is complicated by the ambiguity and variability of
linguistic expression. To cope with these challenges, we propose a model for
comparing sentences that uses a multiplicity of perspectives. We first model
each sentence using a convolutional neural network that extracts features at
multiple levels of granularity and uses multiple types of pooling. We then
compare our sentence representations at several granularities using multiple
similarity metrics. We apply our model to three tasks, including the Microsoft
Research paraphrase identification task and two SemEval semantic textual
similarity tasks. We obtain strong performance on all tasks, rivaling or
exceeding the state-of-the-art without using external resources like WordNet or
parsers.
