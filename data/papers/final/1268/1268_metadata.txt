Abstract#==#Integrating vision and language has long been a dream in work on artificial
intelligence (AI). In the past two years, we have witnessed an explosion of
work that brings together vision and language from images to videos and beyond.
The available corpora have played a crucial role in advancing this area of
research. In this paper,  we propose a set of quality metrics for evaluating
and analyzing the vision & language datasets and categorize them accordingly.
Our analyses show that the most recent datasets have been using more complex
language and more abstract concepts, however, there are different strengths and
weaknesses in each.
