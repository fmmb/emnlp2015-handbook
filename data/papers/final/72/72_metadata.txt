Abstract#==#Natural language generation (NLG) is a critical component of spoken dialogue
and it has a significant impact both on usability and perceived quality.  Most
NLG systems in common use employ rules and heuristics and tend to generate
rigid and stylised responses without the natural variation of human language. 
They are also not easily scaled to systems covering multiple domains and
languages.
This paper presents a statistical language generator based on a semantically
controlled Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) structure.
The LSTM generator can learn from unaligned data by jointly optimising sentence
planning and surface realisation  using a simple cross entropy training
criterion, and language variation can be easily achieved by sampling from
output candidates.   
With fewer heuristics, an objective evaluation in two differing test domains
showed the proposed method improved performance compared to previous methods. 
Human judges scored the LSTM system higher on informativeness and naturalness
and overall preferred it to the other systems.
