Abstract#==#We present an unsupervised method to find lexical variations in Roman Urdu
informal text. Our method includes a phonetic algorithm UrduPhone, a
featurebased similarity function, and a clustering algorithm Lex-C. UrduPhone
encodes roman Urdu strings to their phonetic equivalent representations. This
produces an initial grouping of different spelling variations of a word. The
similarity function incorporates word features and their context.
Lex-C is a variant of k-medoids clustering algorithm that group lexical
variations. It
incorporates a similarity threshold to balance the number of clusters and their
maximum
similarity. We test our system on two datasets of SMS and blogs and show
an f-measure gain of up to 12% from baseline systems.
