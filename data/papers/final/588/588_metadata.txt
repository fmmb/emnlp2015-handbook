Abstract#==#Neural network based methods have obtained great progress on a variety of
natural language processing tasks. However, it is still a challenge task to
model long texts, such as sentences and documents. In this paper, we
propose a multi-timescale long short-term memory (MT-LSTM) neural network to
model long texts. MT-LSTM partitions the hidden states of the standard LSTM
into several groups. Each group is activated at different time period. Thus,
MT-LSTM can model very long documents as well as short sentences. Experiments
on four benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms the other neural
models in text classification task.
