Abstract#==#The information conveyed by some sentences would be more easily understood by a
reader if it were expressed in multiple sentences. We call such sentences
content heavy: these are possibly grammatical but difficult to comprehend,
cumbersome sentences. In this paper we introduce the task of detecting
content-heavy sentences in cross-lingual context. Specifically we develop
methods to identify sentences in Chinese for which English speakers would
prefer translations consisting of more than one sentence.  We base our analysis
and definitions on evidence from multiple human translations and reader
preferences on flow and understandability. We show that machine translation
quality when translating content heavy sentences is markedly worse than overall
quality and that this type of sentence are fairly common in Chinese news. We
demonstrate that sentence length and  punctuation usage in Chinese are not
sufficient clues for accurately detecting heavy sentences and present a richer
classification model that accurately identifies these sentences.
