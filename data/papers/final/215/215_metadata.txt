Abstract#==#This paper describes an approach to large-scale modeling of sentiment analysis
for the social sciences. The goal is to model relations between nation states
through social media. Many cross-disciplinary applications of NLP involve
making predictions (such as predicting political elections), but this paper
instead focuses on a model that is applicable to broader analysis. Do citizens
express opinions in line with their home country's formal relations? When
opinions diverge over time, what is the cause and can social media serve to
detect these changes? We describe several learning algorithms to study how the
populace of a country discusses foreign nations on Twitter, ranging from
state-of-the-art contextual sentiment analysis to some required practical
learners that filter irrelevant tweets. We evaluate on standard sentiment
evaluations, but we also show strong correlations with two public opinion polls
and current international alliance relationships. We conclude with some
political science use cases.
