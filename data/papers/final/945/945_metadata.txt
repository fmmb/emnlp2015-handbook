Abstract#==#We consider the problem of embedding knowledge graphs (KGs) into continuous
vector spaces. Existing methods can only deal with explicit relationships
within each triple, i.e., local connectivity patterns, but cannot handle
implicit relationships across different triples, i.e., contextual connectivity
patterns. This paper proposes context-dependent KG embedding, a two-stage
scheme that takes into account both types of connectivity patterns and obtains
more accurate embeddings. We evaluate our approach on the tasks of link
prediction and triple classification, and achieve significant and consistent
improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
