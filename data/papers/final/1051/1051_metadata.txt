Abstract#==#Automated text summarization is aimed
at extracting essential information from
original text and presenting it in a minimal,
often predefined, number of words.
In this paper, we introduce a new approach
for unsupervised extractive summarization,
based on the Minimum Description
Length (MDL) principle. The
approach represents a text as a transactional
dataset, with sentences as transactions,
and then describes it by itemsets
that stand for frequent sequences of words.
The summary is then compiled from sentences
that compress (and as such, best
describe) the document. The problem of
summarization is reduced to the maximal
coverage, following the assumption that a
summary that best describes the original
text, should cover most of describing the
document word sequences. We solve it by
a greedy algorithm and present the evaluation
results.
