Abstract#==#Discourse relations can be categorized as continuous or discontinuous in the
hypothesis of continuity (Murray, 1997), with continuous relations expressing
normal succession of events in discourse such as temporal, spatial or causal.
Asr and Demberg (2013) propose a markedness measure to test the prediction that
discontinuous relations may have more unambiguous connectives, but restrict the
markedness calculation to relations with explicit connectives only. This paper
extends their measure to explicit and implicit relations and shows that results
from this extension better fit the continuity hypothesis predictions both for
the English Penn Discourse (Prasad et al., 2008) and the Chinese Discourse
(Zhou and Xue, 2015) Treebanks.
