Abstract#==#For fine-grained sentiment analysis, we need to go beyond zero-one polarity and
find a way to compare adjectives that share a common semantic property. In this
paper, we present a semi-supervised approach to assign intensity levels to
adjectives, viz. high, medium and low, where adjectives are compared when they
belong to the same semantic category. For example, in the semantic category of
EXPERTISE, expert, experienced and familiar are
respectively of level high, medium and low. We obtain an overall accuracy of
77% for intensity assignment. We show the significance of considering intensity
information of adjectives in predicting star-rating of reviews. Our intensity
based prediction system results in an accuracy of 59% for a 5-star rated movie
review corpus.
