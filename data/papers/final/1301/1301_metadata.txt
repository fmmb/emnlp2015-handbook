Abstract#==#We extend and improve upon recent work in structured training for neural
network transition-based dependency parsing. We do this by
experimenting with novel features, additional transition systems and by testing
on a wider
array of languages.  In particular, we introduce set-valued features to encode
the predicted morphological properties and part-of-speech confusion sets of the
words being parsed.  We also investigate the use of joint parsing and
part-of-speech tagging in the neural paradigm.                                     
Finally, we
conduct
a
multi-lingual
evaluation that demonstrates the robustness of the overall structured neural
approach, as well as the benefits of the extensions proposed in this work.  Our
research further demonstrates the breadth of the applicability of neural
network methods to dependency parsing, as well as the ease with which new
features can be added to neural parsing models.
