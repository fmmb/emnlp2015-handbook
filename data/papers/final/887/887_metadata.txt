Abstract#==#This paper studies Cumulative Citation Recommendation (CCR) - given an entity
in Knowledge Bases, how to effectively detect its potential citations from
volume text streams. Most previous approaches treated all kinds of features
indifferently to build a global relevance model, in which the prior knowledge
embedded in documents cannot be exploited adequately. To address this problem,
we propose a latent document type discriminative model by introducing a latent
layer to capture the correlations between documents and their underlying types.
The model can better adjust to different types of documents and yield flexible
performance when dealing with a broad range of document types. An extensive set
of experiments has been conducted on TREC-KBA-2013 dataset, and the results
demonstrate that this model can yield a significant performance gain on
recommendation quality as compared to the state-of-the-art.
