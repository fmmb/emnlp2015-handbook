Abstract#==#The narrative cloze is an evaluation metric commonly used for work on automatic
script induction. While prior work in this area has focused on count-based
methods from distributional semantics, such as pointwise mutual information, we
argue that the narrative cloze can be productively reframed as a language
modeling task. By training a discriminative language model for this task, we
attain improvements of up to 27 percent over prior methods on standard
narrative cloze metrics.
