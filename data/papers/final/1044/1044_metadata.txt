Abstract#==#This paper aims to find errors that lead to dialogue breakdowns in
chat-oriented dialogue systems. We collected chat dialogue data,
annotated them with dialogue breakdown labels, and collected
comments describing the error that led to the breakdown. By mining
the comments, we first identified error types. Then, we calculated
the correlation between an error type and the degree of dialogue
breakdown it incurred, quantifying its impact on dialogue
breakdown. This is the first study to quantitatively analyze error
types and their effect in chat-oriented dialogue systems.
