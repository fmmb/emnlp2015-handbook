Abstract#==#A fundamental issue in opinion mining is to search a corpus for opinion units,
each of which typically comprises the evaluation by an author for a target
object from an aspect, such as “This hotel is in a good location”. However,
few attempts have been made to address cases where the validity of an
evaluation is restricted on a condition in the source text, such as “for
traveling with small kids”. In this paper, we propose a method to extract
condition-opinion relations from online reviews, which enables fine-grained
analysis for the utility of target objects depending the user attribute,
purpose, and situation. Our method uses supervised machine learning to identify
sequences of words or phrases that comprise conditions for opinions. We propose
several features associated with lexical and syntactic information, and show
their effectiveness experimentally.
