Abstract#==#The prevalence of temporal references accross all types of natural language
utterances makes temporal analysis a key issue in Natural Language Processing.
This work adresses three research questions: 1/is temporal expression
recognition specific to a particular domain? 2/if so, can we characterize
domain specificity? and 3/how can sudomain  specificity be integrated in a
single tool for unified temporal expression extraction? Herein, we assess
temporal expression recognition from documents written in French covering three
domains. We present a new corpus of clinical narratives annotated for temporal
expressions, and also use existing corpora in the newswire and historical
domains. We show that temporal expressions can be extracted with high
performance across domains (best F-measure 0.96 obtained with a CRF model on
clinical narratives). We argue that domain adaptation for the extraction of
temporal expressions can be done with limited efforts and should cover
pre-processing as well as temporal specific tasks.
