Abstract#==#We present a new morphological analysis model that considers semantic
plausibility of word sequences by using a recurrent neural network language
model (RNNLM). In unsegmented languages, since language models are learned from
automatically segmented texts and inevitably contain errors, it is not apparent
that conventional language models contribute to morphological analysis. To
solve this problem, we do not use language models based on raw word sequences
but use a semantically generalized language model, RNNLM, in morphological
analysis. In our experiments on two Japanese corpora, our proposed model
significantly outperformed baseline models. This result indicates the
effectiveness of RNNLM in morphological analysis.
