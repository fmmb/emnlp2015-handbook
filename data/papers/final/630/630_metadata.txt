Abstract#==#Divergent word order between languages causes delay in simultaneous machine
translation. We present a sentence rewriting method that generates
interpretation-like translations for better speed-accuracy tradeoff. We design
grammaticality and meaning-preserving syntactic transformation rules operating
on a constituent parse tree. We apply the rules to the reference translation,
such that its word order is closer to the source language word order. On
Japanese-English translation (two languages with substantially different
structure), we show that incorporating the rewritten, more monotonic reference
translation into the learning of a phrase-based machine translation system
enables it to produce better translations faster than the baseline system that
uses gold reference translation only.
