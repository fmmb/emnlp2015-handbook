Abstract#==#We present a novel fine-tuning algorithm in a deep hybrid architecture for
semi-supervised text classification.  During each increment of the online
learning process, the fine-tuning algorithm serves as a top-down mechanism for
pseudo-jointly modifying model parameters following a bottom-up generative
learning pass. The resulting model, trained under what we call the
Bottom-Up-Top-Down learning algorithm, is shown to outperform a variety of
competitive models and baselines trained across a wide range of splits between
supervised and unsupervised training data.
