Abstract#==#We present a general framework for comparing multiple groups of documents. A
bipartite graph model is proposed where document groups are represented as one
node set and the comparison criteria are represented as the other node set.
Using this model, we present basic algorithms to extract insights into
similarities and differences among the document groups. Finally, we demonstrate
the versatility of our framework through an analysis of NSF funding programs
for basic research.
