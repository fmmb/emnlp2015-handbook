Abstract#==#Document level sentiment classification remains a challenge: encoding the
intrinsic relations between sentences in the semantic meaning of a document.
To address this, we introduce a neural network model to learn vector-based
document representation in a unified, bottom-up fashion. 
The model first learns sentence representation with convolutional neural
network or long short-term memory.
Afterwards, semantics of sentences and their relations are adaptively encoded
in document representation with gated recurrent neural network.
We conduct document level sentiment classification on four large-scale review
datasets from IMDB and Yelp Dataset Challenge.
Experimental results show that: 
(1) our neural model shows superior performances over several state-of-the-art
algorithms;
(2) gated recurrent neural network dramatically outperforms standard recurrent
neural network in document modeling for sentiment classification.
