Abstract#==#We propose a novel data augmentation approach to enhance computational
behavioral analysis using social media text.
In particular, we collect a Twitter corpus of the descriptions of annoying
behaviors using the #petpeeve hashtags. In the qualitative analysis, we study
the language use in these tweets, with a special focus on the fine-grained
categories and the geographic variation of the language. In quantitative
analysis, we show that lexical and syntactic features are useful for automatic
categorization of annoying behaviors, and frame-semantic features further boost
the performance; that leveraging large lexical embeddings to create additional
training instances significantly improves the lexical model; and incorporating
frame-semantic embedding achieves the best overall performance.
