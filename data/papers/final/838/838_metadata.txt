Abstract#==#Direct content analysis reveals important
details about movies including those of
gender representations and potential biases.
We investigate the differences between
male and female character depictions
in movies, based on patterns of language
used. Specifically, we use an automatically
generated lexicon of linguistic
norms characterizing gender ladenness.
We use multivariate analysis to investigate
gender depictions and correlate them with
elements of movie production. The proposed
metric differentiates between male
and female utterances and exhibits some
interesting interactions with movie genres
and the screenplay writer gender.
