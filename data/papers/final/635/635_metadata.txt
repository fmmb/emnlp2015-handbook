Abstract#==#This paper introduces the task of question-answer driven semantic role labeling
(QA-SRL), where question-answer pairs are used to represent predicate-argument
structure. For example, the verb “introduce” in the previous sentence would
be labeled with the questions “What is introduced?”, and “What introduces
something?”, each paired with the phrase from the sentence that gives the
correct answer. Posing the problem this way allows the questions themselves to
define the set of possible roles, without the need for predefined frame or
thematic role ontologies. It also allows for scalable data collection by
annotators with very little training and no linguistic expertise. We gather
data in two domains, newswire text and Wikipedia articles, and introduce simple
classifier- based models for predicting which questions to ask and what their
answers should be. Our results show that non-expert annotators can produce high
quality QA-SRL data, and also establish baseline performance levels for future
work on this task.
