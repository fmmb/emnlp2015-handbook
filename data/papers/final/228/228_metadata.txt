Abstract#==#Arabic dialect classification has been an important and challenging problem for
Arabic language processing, especially for social media text analysis and
machine translation. In this paper we propose  an approach to improving Arabic
dialect classification with semi-supervised learning: multiple classifiers are
trained with weakly supervised, strongly supervised, and unsupervised data.
Their combination yields significant and consistent improvement on two
different test sets. The dialect classification accuracy is improved by 5% over
the strongly supervised classifier and 20% over the weakly supervised
classifier. Furthermore, when applying the improved dialect classifier to build
a Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) language model (LM), the new model size is
reduced by 70% while the English-Arabic translation quality is improved  by 0.6
BLEU point.
