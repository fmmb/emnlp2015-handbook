Abstract#==#Domestic abuse affects people of every race, class, age, and nation. There is
significant research on the prevalence and effects of domestic abuse; however,
such research typically involves population-based surveys that have high
financial costs. This work provides a qualitative analysis of domestic abuse
using data collected from the social and news-aggregation website reddit.com.
We develop classifiers to detect submissions discussing domestic abuse,
achieving accuracies of up to 92%, a substantial error reduction over its
baseline. Analysis of the top features used in detecting abuse discourse
provides insight into the dynamics of abusive relationships.
