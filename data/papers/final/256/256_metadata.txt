Abstract#==#This paper is concerned with the task of bilingual lexicon induction using
image-based
features. By applying features from a convolutional neural network (CNN), we
obtain state-of-the-art performance on a standard dataset, obtaining a 79%
relative improvement over previous work which uses bags of visual words based
on SIFT features. The CNN image-based approach is also compared with
state-of-the-art linguistic approaches to bilingual lexicon induction, even
outperforming these for one of three language pairs on another standard
dataset. Furthermore, we shed new light on the type of visual similarity metric
to use for genuine similarity versus relatedness tasks, and experiment with
using multiple layers from the same network in an attempt to improve
performance.
