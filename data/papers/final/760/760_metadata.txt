Abstract#==#The conferences ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) and
EMNLP (Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing)
rank among the premier venues that track the research developments 
in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics.
In this paper, we present a study on the research papers of
approximately two decades from these two NLP conferences. We apply
keyphrase extraction and corpus analysis tools to the proceedings
from these venues and propose probabilistic and vector-based
representations to represent the topics published in a venue for a given year.
Next, similarity metrics are studied over pairs of venue representations
to capture the progress of the two venues
with respect to each other and over time.
