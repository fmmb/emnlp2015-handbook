Abstract#==#This study focuses on personality prediction of protagonists in novels based on
the Five-Factor Model of personality. We present and publish a novel
collaboratively built
dataset of fictional character personality and design our task as a text
classification problem. We incorporate a range of semantic features, including
WordNet and VerbNet sense-level information and word vector representations. We
evaluate three machine learning models based on the speech, actions and
predicatives of the main characters, and show that especially the
lexical-semantic features significantly outperform the baselines. Qualitative
analysis reveals that the most predictive features correspond to the reported
findings in personality psychology and NLP experiments on human personality.
