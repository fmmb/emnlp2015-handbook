Abstract#==#The phonotactics of a language describes
the ways in which the sounds of the
language combine to form possible morphemes
and words. Humans can learn
phonotactic patterns at the level of abstract
classes, generalizing across sounds (e.g.,
“words can end in a voiced stop”). Moreover,
they rapidly acquire these generalizations,
even before they acquire soundspecific
patterns. We present a probabilistic
model intended to capture this earlyabstraction
phenomenon. The model represents
both abstract and concrete generalizations
in its hypothesis space from
the outset of learning. This--combined
with a parsimony bias in favor of compact
descriptions of the input data--leads the
model to favor rapid abstraction in a way
similar to human learners.
