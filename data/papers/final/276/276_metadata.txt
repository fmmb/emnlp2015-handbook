Abstract#==#Discourse structure is the hidden link between surface features and
document-level properties, such as sentiment polarity. We show that the
discourse analyses produced by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) parsers can
improve document-level sentiment analysis, via composition of local information
up the discourse tree. First, we show that reweighting discourse units
according to their position in a dependency representation of the rhetorical
structure can yield substantial improvements on lexicon-based sentiment
analysis. Next, we present a recursive neural network over the RST structure,
which offers significant improvements over classification-based methods.
