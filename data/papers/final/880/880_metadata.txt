Abstract#==#Implicit discourse relation recognition remains a serious challenge due to the
absence of discourse connectives. In this paper, we propose a Shallow
Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) for implicit discourse relation
recognition, which contains only one hidden layer but is effective in relation
recognition. The shallow structure alleviates the overÔ¨Åtting problem, while
the convolution and nonlinear operations help preserve the recognition and
generalization ability of our model. Experiments on the benchmark data set show
that our model achieves comparable and even better performance when comparing
against current state-of-the-art systems.
