Abstract#==#We present an unsupervised hard EM approach to automatically mapping
instructional recipes to action graphs, which define what actions should be
performed on which objects and in what order. Recovering such structures can be
challenging, due to unique properties of procedural language where, for
example, verbal arguments are commonly elided when they can be inferred from
context and disambiguation often requires world knowledge. Our probabilistic
model incorporates aspects of procedural semantics and world knowledge, such as
likely locations and selectional preferences for different actions. Experiments
with cooking recipes demonstrate the ability to recover high quality action
graphs, outperforming a strong sequential baseline by 8 points in F1, while
also discovering general-purpose knowledge about cooking.
