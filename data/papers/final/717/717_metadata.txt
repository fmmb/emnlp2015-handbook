Abstract#==#Modeling non-stationary time-series data for making predictions is a
challenging but important task. One of the key issues is to identify long-term
changes accurately in time-varying data. Bayesian Online Change Point Detection
(BO-CPD) algorithms efficiently detect long-term changes without assuming the
Markov property which is vulnerable to local signal noise. We propose a
Document based BO-CPD (DBO-CPD) model which automatically detects long-term
temporal changes of continuous variables based on a novel dynamic Bayesian
analysis which combines a non-parametric regression, the Gaussian Process (GP),
with generative models of texts such as news articles and posts on social
networks. Since texts often include important clues of signal changes, DBO-CPD
enables the accurate prediction of long-term changes accurately. We show that
our algorithm outperforms existing BO-CPDs in two real-world datasets: stock
prices and movie revenues.
