Abstract#==#Spatial relation extraction is the under-investigated
task of identifying the relations on spatial elements. A key challenge
introduced by the recent SpaceEval shared task on spatial relation extraction
is
the identification of MOVELINKs, a type of spatial relation in which up to
eight spatial
elements can participate. To handle the complexity of extracting MOVELINKs,
we combine two ideas that have been successfully applied to information
extraction
tasks, namely tree kernels and multi-pass sieves, proposing the use of an
expanding
parse tree as a novel structured feature for training MOVELINK classifiers. Our
approach yields state-of-the-art results on two key subtasks in SpaceEval.
