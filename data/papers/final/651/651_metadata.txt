Abstract#==#The tasks in fine-grained opinion mining can be regarded as either a
token-level sequence labeling problem or as a semantic compositional task. We
propose a general class of discriminative models based on recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) and word embeddings that can be successfully applied to such
tasks without any task-specific feature engineering effort. Our experimental
results on the task of opinion target identification show that RNNs, without
using any hand-crafted features, outperform feature-rich CRF-based models. Our
framework is flexible, allows us to incorporate other linguistic features, and
achieves results that rival the top perform- ing systems in SemEval-2014.
