Abstract#==#The multilingual Paraphrase Database (PPDB) is a freely available automatically
created resource of paraphrases in multiple languages. In statistical machine
translation, paraphrases can be used to provide translation for
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) phrases. In this paper, we show that a graph
propagation approach that uses PPDB paraphrases can be used to improve overall
translation quality. We provide an extensive comparison with previous work and
show that our PPDB-based method improves the BLEU score by up to 1.79 percent
points. We show that our approach improves on the state of the art in three
different settings: when faced with limited amount of parallel training data; a
domain shift between training and test data; and handling a morphologically
complex source language. Our PPDB-based method outperforms the use of
distributional profiles from monolingual source data.
