Abstract#==#In this paper, a turn-taking phenomenon
taxonomy is introduced, organised accord-
ing to the level of information conveyed.
It is aimed to provide a better grasp of
the behaviours used by humans while talk-
ing to each other, so that they can be
methodically replicated in dialogue sys-
tems. Five interesting phenomena have
been implemented in a simulated environ-
ment: the system barge-in because of an
unclear, an incoherent or a sufficient mes-
sage, the feedback and the user barge-in.
The aim of the experiment is to illustrate
that some phenomena are worth imple-
menting in some cases and others are not.
