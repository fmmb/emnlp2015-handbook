Abstract#==#In this paper, we introduce an approach to automatically map a standard
distributional semantic space onto a set-theoretic model. We predict that there
is a functional relationship between distributional information  and vectorial
concept representations in which dimensions are predicates and weights are
generalised quantifiers. In order to test our prediction, we learn a model of
such relationship over a publicly available dataset of feature norms annotated
with natural language quantifiers.  Our initial experimental results show that,
at least for domain-specific data, we can indeed map between formalisms, and
generate high-quality vector representations which encapsulate set overlap
information. We further investigate the generation of natural language
quantifiers from such vectors.
