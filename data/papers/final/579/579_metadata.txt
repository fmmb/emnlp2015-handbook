Abstract#==#Relation classification is an important research arena in the field of natural
language processing (NLP). In this paper, we present SDP-LSTM, a novel neural
network to classify the relation of two entities in a sentence. The neural
architecture leverages the shortest dependency path (SDP) between two entities;
multichannel recurrent neural networks, with long short term memory (LSTM)
units, pick up heterogeneous information along the SDP. Our proposed model has
several distinct features: (1) The shortest dependency paths retain most
relevant information (to relation classification), while eliminating irrelevant
words in the sentence. (2) The multichannel LSTM networks allow effective
information integration from heterogeneous sources over the dependency paths.
(3) A customized dropout strategy regularizes the neural network to alleviate
overfitting. We test our model on the SemEval 2010 relation classification
task, and achieve an F1-score of 83.7%, higher than competing methods in the
literature.
