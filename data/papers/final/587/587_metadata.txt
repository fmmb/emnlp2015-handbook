Abstract#==#For annotation tasks involving independent judgments, probabilistic models have
been used to infer ground truth labels from data where a crowd of many
annotators labels the same items.  Such models have been shown to produce
results superior to taking the majority vote, but have not been applied to
sequential data. We present two methods to infer ground truth labels from
sequential annotations where we assume judgments are not independent, based on
the observation that an annotator's segments all tend to be several utterances
long. The data consists of crowd labels for annotation of discourse segment
boundaries. The new methods extend Hidden Markov Models to relax the
independence assumption. The two methods are distinct, so positive labels
proposed by both are taken to be ground truth. In addition, results of the
models are checked using metrics that test whether an annotator's accuracy
relative to a given model remains consistent across different conversations.
