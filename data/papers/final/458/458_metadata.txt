Abstract#==#We present a comprehensive study of evaluation methods for  unsupervised
embedding techniques that obtain meaningful representations of words from text.
Different evaluations result in different orderings of embedding methods,
calling into question the common assumption that there is one single optimal
vector representation.
We present new evaluation techniques that directly compare embeddings with
respect to specific queries.
These methods reduce bias, provide greater insight, and allow us to solicit
data-driven relevance judgments rapidly and accurately through crowdsourcing.
