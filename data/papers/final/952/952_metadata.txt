Abstract#==#ROUGE is a widely adopted, automatic evaluation measure for text summarization.
While it has been shown to correlate well with human judgements, it is biased
towards surface lexical similarities. 
This makes it unsuitable for the evaluation of abstractive summarization, or
summaries with substantial paraphrasing. 
We study the effectiveness of word embeddings to overcome this disadvantage of
ROUGE.                                                                           
Specifically, instead of measuring lexical overlaps, word embeddings
are used to compute the semantic similarity of the words used in summaries
instead. 
Our experimental results show that our proposal is able to achieve better
correlations with human judgements when measured with the Spearman and Kendall
rank coefficients.
