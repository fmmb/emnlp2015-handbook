Abstract#==#Cooking recipes exist in abundance; but due to their unstructured
  text format, they are hard to study quantitatively beyond treating
  them as simple bags of words. In this paper, we propose an
  ingredient-instruction dependency tree data structure to represent
  recipes.   The proposed representation allows for more refined 
  comparison of recipes and recipe-parts, and is a step towards semantic
representation of recipes.
  Furthermore, we build a parser that maps  recipes into the proposed
  representation.
  The parser's edge prediction accuracy of 93.5\%
  improves over a strong baseline of 85.7\% (54.5\% error
  reduction).
