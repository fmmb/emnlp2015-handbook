Abstract#==#Temporal taggers are usually developed for a certain language. Besides English,
only few languages have been addressed, and only the temporal tagger HeidelTime
covers several languages. While this tool was manually extended to these
languages, there have been earlier approaches for automatic extensions to a
single target language. In this paper, we present an approach to extend
HeidelTime to all languages in the world. Our evaluation shows promising
results, in particular considering that our approach neither requires language
skills nor training data, but results in a baseline tagger for 200+ languages.
