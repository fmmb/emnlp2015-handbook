Abstract#==#We propose CORE, a novel matrix factorization model that leverages contextual
information for open relation extraction. Our model is based on factorization
machines and integrates facts from various sources, such as knowledge bases or
open information extractors, as well as the context in which these facts have
been observed. We argue that integrating contextual information---such as
metadata about extraction sources, lexical context, or type
information---significantly improves prediction performance. Open information
extractors, for example, may produce extractions that are unspecific or
ambiguous when taken out of context. Our experimental study on a large
real-world dataset indicates that CORE has significantly better prediction
performance than state-of-the-art approaches when contextual information is
available.
