Abstract#==#Deception detection has been receiving an increasing amount of attention from
the computational linguistics, speech, and multimodal processing communities.
One of the major challenges encountered in this task is the availability of
data, and most of the research work to date has been conducted on acted or
artificially collected data. The generated deception models are thus lacking
real-world evidence. In this paper, we explore the use of multimodal real-life
data for the task of deception detection. We develop a new deception dataset
consisting of videos from real-life scenarios, and build deception tools
relying on verbal and nonverbal features. We achieve classification accuracies
in the range of 77-82% when using a model that extracts and fuses features from
the linguistic and visual modalities. We  show that  these  results  outperform
 the  human capability of  identifying deceit.
