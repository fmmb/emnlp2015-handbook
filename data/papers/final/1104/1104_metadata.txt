Abstract#==#We propose to automatically summarize student responses to reflection prompts
and introduce a novel summarization algorithm that differs from traditional
methods in several ways.
 First, since the linguistic units of student inputs range from single words to
multiple sentences, our summaries are created from extracted phrases rather
than from sentences.                     Second, the phrase summarization algorithm
ranks
the
phrases by the number of students who semantically mention a phrase in a
summary. 
  Experimental results show that the proposed phrase summarization approach
achieves significantly better summarization performance on an engineering
course corpus in terms of ROUGE scores when compared to other summarization
methods, including MEAD, LexRank and MMR.
