Abstract#==#A microblog repost tree provides strong clues on how an event described therein
develops. To help social media users capture the main clues of events on
microblogging sites, we propose a novel repost tree summarization framework by
effectively differentiating two kinds of messages on repost trees called
leaders and followers, which are derived from content-level structure
information, i.e., contents of messages and the reposting relations. To this
end, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model is used to detect leaders across
repost tree paths. We then present a variant of random-walk-based summarization
model to rank and select salient messages based on the result of leader
detection. To reduce the error propagation cascaded from leader detection, we
improve the framework by enhancing the random walk with adjustment steps for
sampling from leader probabilities given all the reposting messages. For
evaluation, we construct two annotated corpora, one for leader detection, and
the other for repost tree summarization. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of our method.
