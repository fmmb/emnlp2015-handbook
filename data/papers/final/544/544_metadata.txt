Abstract#==#The paper presents the results of the first large-scale human evaluation of
automatic grammatical error correction (GEC) systems. Twelve participating
systems and the unchanged input of the CoNLL-2014 shared task have been
reassessed in a WMT-inspired human evaluation procedure. Methods introduced for
the Workshop of Machine Translation evaluation campaigns have been adapted to
GEC and extended where necessary. 
The produced rankings are used to evaluate standard metrics for grammatical
error correction in terms of correlation with human judgment.
