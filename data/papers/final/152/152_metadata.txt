Abstract#==#Opinion summarization is the task of producing the summary of a text, such that
the summary also preserves the sentiment of the text. Opinion Summarization is
thus a trade-off between summarization and sentiment analysis. The demand of
compression may drop sentiment bearing sentences, and the demand of sentiment
detection may bring in redundant sentences. We harness the power of
submodularity to strike a balance between two conflicting requirements. We
investigate an incipient class of submodular functions for the problem, and a
partial enumeration based greedy algorithm that has performance guarantee of
63%. Our functions generate summaries such that there is good correlation
between document sentiment and summary sentiment along with good ROUGE score,
which outperforms the-state-of-the-art algorithms.
