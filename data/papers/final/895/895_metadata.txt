Abstract#==#Many NLP systems use dependency parsers as critical components. Jonit learning
parsers usually achieve better parsing accuracies than two-stage methods.
However, classical joint parsing algorithms significantly increase
computational complexity, which makes joint learning impractical. In this
paper, we proposed an efficient dependency parsing algorithm that is capable of
capturing multiple edge-label features, while maintaining low computational
complexity. We evaluate our parser on 14 different languages. Our parser
consistently obtains more accurate results than three baseline systems and
three popular, off-the-shelf parsers.
