Abstract#==#Engaging in a debate with oneself or others to take decisions is an integral
part of our day-today life. A debate on a topic (say, use of performance
enhancing drugs) typically proceeds by one party making an assertion/claim
(say, PEDs are bad for health) and then providing an evidence to support the
claim (say, a 2006 study shows that PEDs have psychiatric side effects). In
this work, we propose the task of automatically detecting such evidences from
unstructured text that support a given claim.
This task has many practical applications in decision support and persuasion
enhancement
in a wide range of domains. We first introduce an extensive benchmark data set
tailored for this task, which allows training statistical models and assessing
their performance. Then, we suggest a system architecture based on supervised
learning to address the evidence detection task. Finally, promising
experimental results are reported.
