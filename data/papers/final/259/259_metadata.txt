Abstract#==#This paper proposes a graph-based readability assessment method using word
coupling. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods such as the readability
formulae, the word-based and feature-based methods, our method develops a
coupled bag-of-words model which combines the merits of word frequencies and
text features. Unlike the general bag-of-words model which assumes words are
independent, our model correlates the words based on their similarities on
readability. By applying TF-IDF (Term Frequency and Inverse Document
Frequency), the coupled TF-IDF matrix is built, and used in the graph-based
classification framework, which involves graph building, merging and label
propagation. Experiments are conducted on both English and Chinese datasets.
The results demonstrate both effectiveness and potential of the method.
