Abstract#==#We present a method of using cohesion to improve discourse element
identification for sentences in student essays. New features for each sentence
are derived by considering its relations to global and local cohesion, which
are created by means of cohesive resources and subtopic coverage. In our
experiments, we obtain significant improvements on identifying all discourse
elements, especially of +5% F1 score on thesis and main idea. The analysis
shows that global cohesion can better capture thesis statements.
