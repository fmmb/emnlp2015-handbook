Abstract#==#Social media is a rich source of rumours and corresponding community reactions.
Rumours reflect different characteristics, some shared and some individual.  We
formulate the problem of classifying tweet level judgements of rumours as a
supervised learning task. Both supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation
are considered, in which tweets from a rumour are classified on the basis of
other annotated rumours. We demonstrate how multi-task learning helps achieve
good results on rumours from the 2011 England riots.
