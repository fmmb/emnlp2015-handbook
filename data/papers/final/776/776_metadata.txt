Abstract#==#Multi-label text categorization is a type of text categorization, where each
document is assigned to one or more categories. Recently, a series of methods
have been developed, which train a classifier for each label, organize the
classifiers in a partially ordered structure and take predictions produced by
the former classifiers as the latter classifiers' features. These
predictions-as-features style methods model high order label dependencies and
obtain high performance. Nevertheless, the predictions-as-features methods
suffer a drawback. When training a classifier for one label, the
predictions-as-features methods can model dependencies between former labels
and the current label, but they can't model dependencies between the current
label and the latter labels. To address this problem, we propose a novel joint
learning algorithm that allows the feedbacks to be propagated from the
classifiers for latter labels to the classifier for the current label. We
conduct experiments using real-world textual data sets, and these experiments
illustrate the predictions-as-features models trained by our algorithm
outperform the original models.
