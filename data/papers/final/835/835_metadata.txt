Abstract#==#Large scale Knowledge Bases (such as NELL, Yago, Freebase, etc) are often
sparse, i.e., a large number of valid relations between existing entities are
missing. Recent research have addressed this problem by augmenting the KB graph
with additional edges mined from a large text corpus while keeping the set of
nodes fixed, and then using the Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) to perform KB
inference over this augmented graph. In this paper, we extend this line of work
by augmenting the KB graph not only with edges, but also with bridging
entities, where both the edges and  bridging entities are mined from a 500
million web text corpus. Through experiments on real-world datasets, we
demonstrate the value of bridging entities in improving the performance and
running times of PRA in the KB inference task.
