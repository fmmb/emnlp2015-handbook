Abstract#==#A wide range of applications, from social media to scientific literature
analysis, involve graphs in which documents are connected by links. We
introduce a topic model for link prediction based on the intuition that linked
documents will tend to have similar topic distributions, integrating a
max-margin learning criterion and lexical term weights in the loss function. We
validate our approach on the tweets from 2,000 Sina Weibo users and evaluate
our model's reconstruction of the social network.
