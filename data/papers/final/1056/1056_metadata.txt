Abstract#==#If intelligent systems are to interact with humans in a natural manner, the
ability to describe daily life activities is important. To achieve this,
sensing human activities by capturing multimodal information is necessary. In
this study, we consider a smart environment for sensing activities with respect
to realistic scenarios. We next propose a sentence generation system from
observed multimodal information in a bottom up manner using multilayered
multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation and Bayesian hidden Markov models. We
evaluate the grammar learning and sentence generation as a complete process
within a realistic setting. The experimental result reveals the effectiveness
of the proposed method.
