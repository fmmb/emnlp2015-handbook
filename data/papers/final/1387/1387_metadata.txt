Abstract#==#For sentiment classification, it is often recognized that embedding based on
distributional hypothesis is weak in capturing sentiment
contrast--contrasting words may have similar local context. Based on broader
context, we propose to incorporate Theta Pure Dependence (TPD) into the
Paragraph Vector method to reinforce topical and sentimental information. TPD
has a theoretical guarantee that the word dependency is pure, i.e., the
dependence pattern has the integral meaning whose underlying distribution can
not be conditionally factorized. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
performance on text classification tasks.
