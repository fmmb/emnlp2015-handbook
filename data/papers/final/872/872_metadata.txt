Abstract#==#Due to the commonality in natural language, negation focus plays a critical
role in deep understanding of context. However, existing studies for negation
focus identification major on supervised learning which is time-consuming and
expensive due to manual preparation of annotated corpus. To address this
problem, we propose an unsupervised word-topic graph model to represent and
measure the focus candidates from both lexical and topic perspectives.
Moreover, we propose a document-sensitive biased PageRank algorithm to optimize
the ranking scores of focus candidates. Evaluation on the *SEM 2012 shared task
corpus shows that our proposed method outperforms the state of the art on
negation focus identification.
