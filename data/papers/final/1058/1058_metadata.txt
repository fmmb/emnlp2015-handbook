Abstract#==#Continuous-space translation models have recently
  emerged as extremely powerful ways to boost the performance of 
  existing translation systems. A simple, yet effective way to integrate such
  models in inference is to use them in an $\nb$-best rescoring step. In
  this paper, we focus on this scenario and show that the performance
  gains in rescoring can be greatly increased when the neural network
  is trained jointly with all the other model parameters, using an
  appropriate objective function. 
  Our approach is validated on
  two domains, where it outperforms strong baselines.
