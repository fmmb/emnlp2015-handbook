Abstract#==#We provide a generalization of discriminative lexicalized shift reduce
parsing techniques for phrase structure grammar to a wide range of
morphologically rich languages. The model is efficient and outperforms
recent strong baselines on almost all languages considered. It takes advantage
of a dependency based modelling of morphology and a shallow modelling of con-
stituency boundaries.
