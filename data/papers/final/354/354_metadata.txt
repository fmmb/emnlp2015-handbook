Abstract#==#As conventional word alignment search algorithms usually ignore the consistency
constraint in translation rule extraction, improving alignment accuracy does
not necessarily increase translation quality. We propose to use coverage, which
reflects how well extracted phrases can recover the training data, to enable
word alignment to model consistency and correlate better with machine
translation. This can be done by introducing an objective that maximizes both
alignment model score and coverage. We introduce an efficient algorithm to
calculate coverage on the fly during search. Experiments show that our
consistency-aware search algorithm significantly outperforms both generative
and discriminative alignment approaches across various languages and
translation models.
