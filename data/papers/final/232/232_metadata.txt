Abstract#==#Representation learning of knowledge bases (KBs) aims to embed both entities
and relations into a low-dimensional space. Most existing methods only consider
direct relations in representation learning. We argue that multiple-step
relation paths also contain rich inference patterns between entities, and
propose a path-based representation learning model. This model considers
relation paths as translations between entities for representation learning,
and addresses two key challenges: (1) Since not all relation paths are
reliable, we design a path-constraint resource allocation algorithm to measure
the reliability of relation paths. (2) We represent relation paths via semantic
composition of relation embeddings. Experimental results on real-world datasets
show that, as compared with baselines, our model achieves significant and
consistent improvements on knowledge base completion and relation extraction
from text.
