Abstract#==#Understanding language goes hand in hand with the ability to integrate complex
contextual information obtained via perception. In this work, we present a
novel task for grounded language understanding: disambiguating a sentence given
a visual scene which depicts one of the possible interpretations of that
sentence. To this end, we introduce a new multimodal corpus containing
ambiguous sentences, representing a wide range of syntactic, semantic and
discourse ambiguities, coupled with videos that visualize the different
interpretations for each sentence. We address this task by extending a vision
model which determines if a sentence is depicted by a video. We demonstrate how
such a model can be adjusted to recognize different interpretations of the same
underlying sentence, allowing to disambiguate sentences in a unified fashion
across the different ambiguity types.
