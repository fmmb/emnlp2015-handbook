Abstract#==#Usernames are ubiquitous on the Internet,and they are often suggestive of user
demographics. This work looks at the degree to which gender and language can be
inferred  from a username alone by making use of unsupervised morphology
induction to decompose              usernames into sub-units. Experimental results on
the
two tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed morphological features
compared to a character n-gram baseline.
