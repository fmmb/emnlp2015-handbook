Abstract#==#Sarcasm is generally characterized as a figure of speech that involves the
substitution of a literal by a figurative meaning, which is usually the
opposite of the original literal meaning. We re-frame the sarcasm detection
task as a type of word sense disambiguation problem, where the sense of a word
is either literal or sarcastic. We call this the Literal/Sarcastic Sense
Disambiguation (LSSD) task. We address two issues: 1) how to collect a set of
target words that  can have either literal or sarcastic meanings depending on
context; and 2) given an utterance and a target word, how to automatically
detect whether the target word is used in the literal or the sarcastic sense.
For the latter, we investigate several distributional semantics methods and
show that a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier with a modified kernel
using word embeddings achieves a 7-10% F1 improvement over a strong lexical
baseline.
