Abstract#==#We propose a summarization approach for scientific articles which takes
advantage of the citation-context and the document discourse model. While
citations have been previously used in generating scientific summaries, they
lack the related context from the referenced article and therefore do not
accurately reflect the article's content.
Our method overcomes the problem of inconsistency between the citation summary
and the article's content by providing context for each citation. We also
leverage the inherent scientific article's discourse model for producing better
summaries. We show that our proposed method effectively improves over existing
summarization approaches (greater than 30% improvement over the best performing
baseline) in terms of ROUGE scores on TAC2014 scientific summarization
dataset. While the dataset we use for evaluation is in the biomedical domain,
most of our approaches are general and therefore adaptable to other domains.
