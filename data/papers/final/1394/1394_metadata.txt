Abstract#==#Machine comprehension of text is the overarching goal of a great deal of
research in natural language processing. The Machine Comprehension Test
(Richardson et al., 2013) was recently proposed to assess methods on an
open-domain, extensible, and easy-to-evaluate task consisting of two datasets.
In this paper we develop a lexical matching method that takes into account
multiple context windows, question types and coreference resolution. We show
that the proposed method outperforms the baseline of Richardson et al. (2013),
and despite its relative simplicity, is comparable to recent work using machine
learning. We hope that our approach will inform future work on this task.
Furthermore, we argue that MC500 is harder than MC160 due to the way question
an- swer pairs were created.
