Abstract#==#A key challenge in vocabulary acquisition is learning which of the many
possible meanings is appropriate for a word. The word generalization problem
refers to how children associate a word such as dog with a meaning at the
appropriate category level in the taxonomy of objects, such as Dalmatians,
dogs, or animals. We present the first computational study of word
generalization integrated within a word learning model. The model simulates
child and adult patterns of word generalization in a word-learning task. These
patterns arise due to the interaction of type and token frequencies in the
input data, an influence often observed in peopleâ€™s generalization of
linguistic categories.
