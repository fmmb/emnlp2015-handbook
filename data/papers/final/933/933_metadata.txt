Abstract#==#The enormous amount of information on the Internet has raised the challenge of
highlighting new information in the context of already viewed content. This
type of intelligent interface can save users time and prevent frustration. Our
goal is to scale out novelty detection to large web properties like Google and
Yahoo News. We present a set of efficient, light-weight features for online
novelty scoring and a fast nonlinear feature transformation method using Deep
Neural Network. Our experimental results on the TREC 2004 datasets show that
the proposed method is not only efficient but also very powerful, significantly
surpassing the best challenge system at TREC 2004.
