Abstract#==#We propose a transition-based model for joint word segmentation, POS tagging
and text normalization. Different from previous methods, the model can be
trained on standard text corpora, overcoming the lack of annotated microblog
corpora. To evaluate our model, we develop an annotated corpus based on
microblogs. Experimental results show that our joint model can help improve the
performance of word segmentation on microblogs, giving an error reduction in
segmentation accuracy of 12.02%, compared to the traditional approach.
