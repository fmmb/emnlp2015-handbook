Abstract#==#Path queries on a knowledge graph can be used to answer compositional questions
such as “What languages are spoken by people living in Lisbon?”. However,
knowledge graphs often have missing facts (edges) which disrupts path queries.
Recent models for knowledge base completion impute missing facts by embedding
knowledge graphs in vector spaces. We show that these models can be recursively
applied to answer path queries, but that they suffer from cascading errors.
This motivates a new “compositional” training objective, which dramatically
improves all models’ ability to answer path queries, in some cases more than
doubling accuracy. On a standard knowledge base completion task, we also
demonstrate that compositional training acts as a novel form of structural
regularization, reliably improving performance across all base models (reducing
errors by up to 43%) and achieving new state-of-the-art results.
