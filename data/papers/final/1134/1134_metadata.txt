Abstract#==#Automatic text summarization is widely regarded as the highly difficult
problem, partially because of the lack of large text summarization data set.
Due to the great challenge of constructing the large scale summaries for full
text, in this paper, we introduce a large corpus of Chinese short text
summarization dataset constructed from the Chinese microblogging website Sina
Weibo, which is released to the
public\footnote{http://icrc.hitsz.edu.cn/Article/show/139.html}. This corpus
consists of over 2 million real Chinese short texts with short summaries given
by the author of each text. We also manually tagged the relevance of 10,666
short summaries with their corresponding short texts. Based on the corpus, we
introduce recurrent neural network for the summary generation and achieve
promising results, which not only shows the usefulness of the proposed corpus
for short text summarization research, but also provides a baseline for further
research on this topic.
