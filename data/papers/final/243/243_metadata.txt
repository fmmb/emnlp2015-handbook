Abstract#==#We present a new approach for unsupervised semantic role labeling
  that leverages distributed representations.  We induce embeddings to
  represent a predicate, its arguments and their complex
  interdependence.  Argument embeddings are learned from surrounding
  contexts involving the predicate and neighboring arguments, while
  predicate embeddings are learned from argument contexts.  The
  induced representations are clustered into roles using a linear
  programming formulation of hierarchical clustering, where we can
  model task-specific knowledge.  Experiments show improved
  performance over both previous unsupervised semantic role labeling
  approaches and other distributed word representation models.
