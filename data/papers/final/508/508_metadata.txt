Abstract#==#Online forum discussions proceed differently from face-to-face conversations
and any single thread on an online forum contains posts on different subtopics.
This work aims to characterize the content of a forum thread as a conversation
tree of topics. We present models that jointly perform two tasks: segment a
thread into subparts, and assign a topic to each part. Our core idea is a
definition of topic structure using probabilistic grammars. By leveraging the
flexibility of two grammar formalisms, Context-Free Grammars and
Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems, our models create desirable structures
for forum threads: our topic segmentation is hierarchical, links non-adjacent
segments on the same topic, and jointly labels the topic during segmentation.
We show that our models outperform a number of tree generation baselines.
