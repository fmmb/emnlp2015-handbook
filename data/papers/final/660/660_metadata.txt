Abstract#==#With the exponential growth of scholarly data during the past few years,
effective methods for topic classification are greatly needed. Current
approaches usually require large amounts of expensive labeled data in order to
make accurate predictions. In this paper, we posit that, in addition to a
research articleâ€™s textual content, its citation network also contains
valuable information. We describe a co-training approach that uses the text and
citation information of a research article as two different views to predict
the topic of the article. We show that this method improves significantly over
the individual classifiers, while also bringing a substantial reduction in the
amount of labeled data required for training accurate classifiers.
