Abstract#==#In this paper we focus on a new problem of event coreference resolution across
television news videos. Based on the observation that the contents from
multiple data modalities are complementary, we develop a novel approach to
jointly encode effective features from both closed captions and video key
frames. Experiment results demonstrate that visual features provided 7.2%
absolute F-score gain on state-of-the-art text based event extraction and
coreference resolution.
