Abstract#==#Semantic parsing maps a sentence in natural language into a structured meaning
representation. Previous studies show that semantic parsing with synchronous
context-free grammars (SCFGs) achieves favorable performance over most other
alternatives. Motivated by the observation that the performance of semantic
parsing with SCFGs is closely tied to the translation rules, this paper
explores to extend translation rules with high quality and increased coverage
in three ways. First, we introduce structure informed non-terminals, better
guiding the parsing in favor of well formed structure, instead of using a
uniformed non-terminal in SCFGs. Second, we examine the difference between word
alignments for semantic parsing and statistical machine translation (SMT) to
better adapt word alignment in SMT to semantic parsing. And finally, we address
the unknown word translation issue via synthetic translation rules. Evaluation
on the standard GeoQuery benchmark dataset shows that our approach achieves
the state-of-the-art across various languages, including English, German and
Greek.
