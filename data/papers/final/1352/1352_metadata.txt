Abstract#==#This paper addresses the question of how language use affects community
reaction to comments in online discussion forums, and the relative importance
of the message vs. the messenger. A new comment ranking task is proposed based
on community annotated karma in Reddit discussions, which controls for topic
and timing of comments. Experimental work with discussion threads from six
subreddits shows that the importance of different types of language features
varies with the community of interest.
