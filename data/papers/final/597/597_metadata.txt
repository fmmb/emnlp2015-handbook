Abstract#==#Comparison is one of the most important phenomena in language for expressing
objective and subjective facts about various entities. Systems that can
understand and reason over comparative structure can play a major role in the
applications which require deeper understanding of language. In this paper we
present a novel semantic framework for representing the meaning of comparative
structures in natural language, which models comparisons as predicate-argument
pairs inter-connected with semantic roles. Our framework supports not only
adjectival, but also adverbial, nominal, and verbal comparatives. With this
paper, we provide a novel dataset of gold-standard comparison structures
annotated according to our semantic framework.
