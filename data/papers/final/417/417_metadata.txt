Abstract#==#In this paper we present the first ever, to the best of our knowledge,
discourse parser for multi-party chat dialogues. Discourse in multi-party
dialogues dramatically differs from monologues since threaded conversations are
commonplace rendering prediction of the discourse structure compelling.
Moreover, the fact that our data come from chats renders the use of syntactic
and lexical information useless since people take great liberties in expressing
themselves lexically and syntactically. We use the dependency parsing paradigm
as has been done in the past (Muller et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014). We learn
local probability distributions and then use MST for decoding. We achieve
0.680\ F_1 on unlabelled structures and 0.516\ F_1 on fully labeled structures
which is better than many state of the art systems for monologues, despite the
inherent difficulties that multi-party chat dialogues have.
