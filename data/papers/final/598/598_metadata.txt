Abstract#==#State of the art in opinion mining mainly focuses on positive and negative
sentiment summarisation of online customer reviews. We observe that reviewers
tend to provide ad- vice, recommendations and tips to the fellow customers on a
variety of points of interest. In this work, we target the automatic detection
of suggestion expressing sentences in customer reviews. This is a novel
problem, and therefore to begin with, requires a well formed problem definition
and benchmark dataset. This work provides a 3- fold contribution, namely,
problem definition, benchmark dataset, and an approach for detection of
suggestions for the customers. The problem is framed as a sentence
classification problem, and a set of linguistically motivated features are
proposed. Analysis of the nature of suggestions, and classification errors,
highlight challenges and research opportunities associated with this problem.
