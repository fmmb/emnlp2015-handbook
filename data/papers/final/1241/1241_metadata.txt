Abstract#==#We present a semi-supervised approach to improve dependency parsing accuracy by
using bilexical statistics derived from auto-parsed data. The method is based
on estimating the attachment potential of head-modifier words, by taking into
account not only the head and modifier words themselves, but also the words
surrounding the head and the modifier. When integrating the learned statistics
as features in a graph-based parsing model, we observe nice improvements in
accuracy when parsing various English datasets.
