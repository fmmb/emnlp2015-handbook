Abstract#==#While agreement-based joint training has proven to deliver state-of-the-art
alignment accuracy, the produced word alignments are usually restricted to
one-to-one mappings because of the hard constraint on agreement. We propose a
general framework to allow for arbitrary loss functions that measure the
disagreement between asymmetric alignments. The loss functions can not only be
defined between asymmetric alignments but also between alignments and other
latent structures such as phrase segmentation. We use a Viterbi EM algorithm to
train the joint model since the inference is intractable. Experiments on
Chinese-English translation show that joint training with generalized agreement
achieves significant improvements over two state-of-the-art alignment methods.
