Abstract#==#In concept-based summarization, sentence selection is modelled as a budgeted
maximum coverage problem. As this problem is NP-hard, pruning low-weight
concepts is required for the solver to find optimal solutions efficiently. This
work shows that reducing the number of concepts in the model leads to lower
ROUGE scores, and more importantly to the presence of multiple optimal
solutions. We address these issues by extending the model to provide a single
optimal solution, and eliminate the need for concept pruning using an
approximation algorithm that achieves comparable performance to exact
inference.
