Abstract#==#Accurate multilingual transfer parsing typically relies on careful feature
engineering. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical tensor-based approach for
this task. This approach induces a compact feature representation by combining
atomic features. However, unlike traditional tensor models, it enables us to
incorporate prior knowledge about desired feature interactions, eliminating
invalid feature combinations. To this end, we use a hierarchical structure that
uses intermediate embeddings to capture desired feature combinations.
Algebraically, this hierarchical tensor is equivalent to the sum of traditional
tensors with shared components, and thus can be effectively trained with
standard online algorithms. In both unsupervised and semi-supervised transfer
scenarios, our hierarchical tensor consistently improves UAS and LAS over
state-of-the-art multilingual transfer parsers and the traditional tensor model
across 10 different languages.
