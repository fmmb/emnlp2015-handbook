Abstract#==#Efficient computation of n-gram posterior probabilities from lattices has
applications in lattice-based minimum Bayes-risk decoding in statistical
machine translation and the estimation of expected document frequencies from
spoken corpora. In this paper, we present an algorithm for computing the
posterior probabilities of all n-grams in a lattice and constructing a minimal
deterministic weighted finite-state automaton associating each n-gram with its
posterior for efficient storage and retrieval. Our algorithm builds upon the
best known algorithm in literature for computing n-gram posteriors from
lattices and leverages the following observations to significantly improve the
time and space requirements: i) the n-grams for which the posteriors will be
computed typically comprises all n-grams in the lattice up to a certain length,
ii) posterior is equivalent to expected count for an n-gram that do not repeat
on any path, iii) there are efficient algorithms for computing n-gram expected
counts from lattices. We present experimental results comparing our algorithm
with the best known algorithm in literature as well as a baseline algorithm
based on weighted finite-state automata operations.
