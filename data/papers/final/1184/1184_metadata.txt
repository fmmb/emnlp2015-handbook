Abstract#==#A prerequisite relation describes a basic relation among concepts in cognition,
education and other areas. However, as a semantic relation, it has not been
well studied in computational linguistics. We investigate the problem of
measuring prerequisite relations among concepts and propose a simple link-based
metric, namely reference distance (RefD), that effectively models the relation
by measuring how differently two concepts refer to each other. Evaluations on
two datasets that include seven domains show that our single metric based
method outperforms existing supervised learning based methods.
