Abstract#==#We propose a novel method for acquiring entailment pairs of binary patterns on
a large-scale.
This method exploits the transitivity of entailment and a self-training scheme
to improve the performance of an already strong supervised classifier for
entailment, and unlike previous methods that exploit transitivity, it works on
a large-scale. With it we acquired 138.1 million pattern pairs with 70%
precision with such non-trivial lexical substitution as “use Y to distribute
X” -> “X is available on Y” whose extraction is considered difficult.
This represents 50.4 million more pattern pairs (a 57.5% increase) than what
our supervised baseline extracted at the same precision.
