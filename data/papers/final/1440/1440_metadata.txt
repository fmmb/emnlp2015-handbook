Abstract#==#We consider the task of named entity
recognition for Chinese social media. The
long line of work in Chinese NER has focused
on formal domains, and NER for
social media has been largely restricted
to English. We present a new corpus of
Weibo messages annotated for both name
and nominal mentions. Additionally, we
evaluate three types of neural embedding
for representing Chinese text. Finally, we
propose a joint training objective for the
embeddings that makes use of both (NER)
labeled and unlabeled raw text. Our methods
yield a 9% improvement over a state-of-the-art
baseline.
