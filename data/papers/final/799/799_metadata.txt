Abstract#==#While most previous work on Wikification has focused on written texts, this
paper presents a Wikification approach for spoken dialogues. A set of analyzers
are proposed to learn dialogue-specific properties along with domain knowledge
of conversations from Wikipedia. Then, the analyzed properties are used as
constraints for generating candidates, and the candidates are ranked to find
the appropriate links. The experimental results show that our proposed approach
can significantly improve the performances of the task in human-human
dialogues.
