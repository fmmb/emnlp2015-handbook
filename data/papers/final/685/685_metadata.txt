Abstract#==#In this paper, we address the challenge of creating accurate and robust part-
of- speech taggers for low-resource languages. We propose a method that
leverages existing parallel data between the target language and a large set of
resource-rich languages without ancillary resources such as tag dictionaries.
Crucially, we use CCA to induce latent word representations that incorporate
cross-genre distributional cues, as well as projected tags from a full array of
resource-rich languages. We develop a probability-based confidence model to
identify words with highly likely tag projections and use these words to train
a multi-class SVM using the CCA features.  Our method yields average
performance
of 85% accuracy for languages with almost no resources, outperforming a
state-of-the-art
partially-observed CRF model.
