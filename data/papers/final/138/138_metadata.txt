Abstract#==#We explore some of the practicalities of using random walk inference methods,
such as the Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA), for the task of knowledge base
completion. We
show that the random walk probabilities computed (at great expense) by PRA
provide no discernible benefit to performance on this task, and so they can
safely be
dropped. This allows us to define a simpler algorithm for generating feature
matrices from graphs, which we call subgraph feature extraction (SFE). In
addition to being conceptually simpler than PRA, SFE is much more efficient,
reducing computation by an order of magnitude, and more expressive, allowing
for much richer features than just paths between two nodes in a graph. We show
experimentally that this technique gives substantially better performance than
PRA and its variants, improving mean average precision from .432 to .528 on a
knowledge base completion task using the NELL knowledge base.
