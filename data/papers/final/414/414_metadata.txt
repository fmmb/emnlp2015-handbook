Abstract#==#Deep compositional models of meaning acting on distributional representations
of words in order to produce vectors of larger text constituents are evolving
to a popular area of NLP research. We detail a compositional distributional
framework based on a rich form of word embeddings that aims at facilitating the
interactions between words in the context of a sentence. Embeddings and
composition layers are jointly learned against a generic objective that
enhances the vectors with syntactic information from the surrounding context.
Furthermore, each word is associated with a number of senses, the most
plausible of which is selected dynamically during the composition process. We
evaluate the produced vectors qualitatively and quantitatively with positive
results. At the sentence level, the effectiveness of the framework is
demonstrated on the MSRPar task, for which we report results within the
state-of-the-art range.
