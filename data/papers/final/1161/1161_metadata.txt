Abstract#==#While it has been established that transitions between discourse relations are
important for coherence, such information has not so far been used to aid in
language generation. We introduce an approach to discourse planning for
concept-to-text generation systems which simultaneously determines the order of
messages and the discourse relations between them. This approach makes it
straightforward to use statistical transition models, such as n-gram models of
discourse relations learned from an annotated corpus. We show that using such a
model significantly improves the quality of the generated text as judged by
humans.
