Abstract#==#Sentiment analysis has been a major area of interest, for which the existence
of high-quality resources is crucial. In Arabic, there is a reasonable number
of sentiment lexicons but with major deficiencies. The paper presents a
large-scale Standard Arabic Sentiment Lexicon (SLSA) that is publicly available
for free and avoids the deficiencies in the current resources. SLSA has the
highest up-to-date reported coverage. The construction of SLSA is based on
linking the lexicon of AraMorph with SentiWordNet along with a few heuristics
and powerful back-off. SLSA shows a relative improvement of 37.8% over a
state-of-the-art lexicon when tested for accuracy. It also outperforms it by an
absolute 3.5% of F1-score when tested for sentiment analysis.
