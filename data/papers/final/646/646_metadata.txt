Abstract#==#A simile is a comparison between two
essentially unlike things, such as "Jane
swims like a dolphin". Similes often express
a positive or negative sentiment toward
something, but recognizing the polarity
of a simile can depend heavily on
world knowledge. For example, "memory
like an elephant" is positive, but "memory
like a sieve" is negative. Our research
explores methods to recognize the polarity
of similes on Twitter. We train classifiers
using lexical, semantic, and sentiment features,
and experiment with both manually
and automatically generated training
data. Our approach yields good performance
at identifying positive and negative
similes, and substantially outperforms existing
sentiment resources.
