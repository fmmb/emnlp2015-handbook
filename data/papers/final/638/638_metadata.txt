Abstract#==#This paper describes a novel target-side syntactic language model for
phrase-based statistical machine translation, bilingual structured language
model. Our approach represents a new way to adapt structured language models
(Chelba and Jelinek, 2000) to statistical machine translation, and a first
attempt to adapt them to phrase-based statistical machine translation. We
propose a number of variations of the bilingual structured language model and
evaluate them in a series of rescoring experiments. Rescoring of 1000-best
translation lists produces statistically significant improvements of up to 0.7
BLEU over a strong baseline for Chinese-English, but does not yield
improvements for Arabic-English.
