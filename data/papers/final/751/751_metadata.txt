Abstract#==#IBM Model 1 is a classical alignment model. Of the first generation word-based
SMT models, it was the only such model with a concave objective function. For
concave optimization problems like IBM Model 1, we have guarantees on the
convergence of optimization algorithms such as Expectation Maximization (EM).
However, as was pointed out recently, the objective of IBM Model 1 is not
strictly concave and there is quite a bit of alignment quality variance within
the optimal solution set. In this work we detail a strictly concave version of
IBM Model 1 whose EM algorithm is a simple modification of the original EM
algorithm of Model 1 and does not require the tuning of a learning rate or the
insertion of an $l_{2}$ penalty. Moreover, by addressing Model 1's
shortcomings, we achieve AER and F-Measure improvements over the classical
Model 1 by over 30\%
