Abstract#==#We ask how much information a human translator adds to an original text, and we
provide a bound. We address this question in the context of bilingual text
compression: given a source text, how many bits of additional information are
required to specify the target text produced by a human translator? We develop
new compression algorithms and establish a benchmark task.
