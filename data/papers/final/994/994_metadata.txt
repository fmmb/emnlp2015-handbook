Abstract#==#We consider the task of automatically identifying participants' motivations in
the public health campaign Movember and investigate the impact of the different
motivations on the amount of campaign donations raised. Our classification
scheme is based on the Social Identity Model of Collective Action (van Zomeren
et al., 2008). We find that automatic classification based on Movember profiles
is fairly accurate, while automatic classification based on tweets is
challenging. Using our classifier, we find a strong relation between types of
motivations and donations. Our study is a first step towards scaling-up
collective action research methods.
