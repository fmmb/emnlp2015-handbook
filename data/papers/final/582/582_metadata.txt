Abstract#==#Elementary-level science exams pose significant knowledge acquisition and
reasoning challenges for automatic question answering. We develop a system that
reasons with knowledge derived from textbooks, represented in a subset of
first-order logic. Automatic extraction, while scalable, often results in
knowledge that is incomplete and noisy, motivating use of reasoning mechanisms
that handle uncertainty. 

Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) seem a natural model for expressing such
knowledge, but the exact way of leveraging MLNs is by no means obvious. We
investigate three ways of
applying MLNs to our task. First, we simply use the
extracted science rules directly as MLN clauses and exploit the structure
present in hard constraints to improve
tractability.
Second, we interpret science rules as describing prototypical
entities, resulting in a drastically simplified but brittle network. Our
third approach, called Praline, uses MLNs to align lexical elements as well as
define and control how inference should be performed in this task. Praline
demonstrates a 15\% accuracy boost and a 10x reduction in runtime as compared
to other MLN-based methods, and comparable accuracy to word-based baseline
approaches.
