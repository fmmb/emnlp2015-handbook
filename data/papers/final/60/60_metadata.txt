Abstract#==#Recursive neural models, which use syntactic parse trees
to recursively generate representations bottom-up, are a popular architecture.
However there have not been rigorous evaluations showing for
exactly which tasks this syntax-based method is appropriate.
In this paper, we benchmark {\it recursive} neural models
against sequential {\it recurrent} neural models,
enforcing apples-to-apples comparison as much as possible. 
We investigate 4 tasks:
(1) sentiment classification at the sentence level and phrase level;
(2) matching questions to answer-phrases;
(3) discourse parsing;
(4) semantic relation extraction.

Our goal
is to understand better when, and why, recursive models can outperform 
simpler models.  
We find that recursive models help mainly
on tasks (like semantic relation extraction) that require long-distance
connection modeling, particularly on very long sequences.
We then introduce a method for allowing recurrent models to achieve 
similar performance: breaking long sentences into  clause-like units
at punctuation and processing them separately before combining.
Our results thus help understand the limitations of both classes of models,
and suggest directions for improving recurrent models.
