Abstract#==#When translating between two languages that differ in their degree of
morphological synthesis, syntactic structures in one language may be realized
as morphological structures in the other, and SMT models need a mechanism to
learn such translations. Prior work has used morpheme splitting with flat
representations that do not encode the hierarchical structure between
morphemes, but this structure is relevant for learning morphosyntactic
constraints and selectional preferences. We propose to model syntactic and
morphological structure jointly in a dependency translation model, allowing the
system to generalize to the level of morphemes. We present a dependency
representation of German compounds and particle verbs that results in
improvements in translation quality of 1.4-1.8 BLEU in the WMT
English-German translation task.
