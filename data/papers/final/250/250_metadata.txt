Abstract#==#In hierarchical phrase-based translation, coarse-grained nonterminal Xs may
generate inappropriate translations due to the lack of sufficient information
for phrasal substitution. In this paper we propose a framework to refine
nonterminals in hierarchical translation rules with realvalued semantic
representations. The semantic representations are learned via a weighted mean
value and a minimum distance method using phrase vector representations
obtained
from large scale monolingual corpus. Based on the learned semantic vectors, we
build a semantic nonterminal refinement model to measure semantic similarities
between phrasal substitutions and nonterminal Xs in translation rules.
Experiment results on Chinese-English translation show that the proposed model
significantly improves translation quality on NIST test sets.
