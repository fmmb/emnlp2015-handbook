Abstract#==#This paper addresses text categorization problem that training data may derive
from a different time period from the test data. We present a learning
framework which extends a boosting technique to learn accurate model for
timeline adaptation.
The results showed that the method was comparable to the current
state-of-the-art biased-SVM method, especially the method is effective when the
creation time period of the test data differs greatly from the training data.
