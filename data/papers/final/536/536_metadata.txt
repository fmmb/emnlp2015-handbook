Abstract#==#Understanding entailment and contradiction is fundamental to understanding
natural language, and inference about entailment and contradiction is a
valuable testing ground for the development of semantic representations.
However, machine learning research in this area has been dramatically limited
by the lack of large-scale resources. To address this, we introduce the
Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus, a new, freely available collection
of labeled sentence pairs, written by humans doing a novel grounded task based
on image captioning. At 570K pairs, it is two orders of magnitude larger than
all other resources of its type. This increase in scale allows lexicalized
classifiers to outperform some sophisticated existing entailment models, and it
allows a neural network-based model to perform competitively on natural
language inference benchmarks for the first time.
