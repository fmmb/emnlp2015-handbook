Abstract#==#Web reviews have been intensively studied in argumentation-related tasks such
as sentiment analysis. However, due to their focus on content-based features,
many sentiment analysis approaches are effective only for reviews from those
domains they have been specifically modeled for. This paper puts its focus on
domain independence and asks whether a general model can be found for how
people argue in web reviews. Our hypothesis is that people express their global
sentiment on a topic with similar sequences of local sentiment independent of
the domain. We model such sentiment flow robustly under uncertainty through
abstraction. To test our hypothesis, we predict global sentiment based on
sentiment flow. In systematic experiments, we improve over the domain
independence of strong baselines. Our findings suggest that sentiment flow
qualifies as a general model of web review argumentation.
