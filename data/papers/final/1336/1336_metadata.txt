Abstract#==#Distributed word representations are very useful for capturing semantic
information and have been successfully applied in many NLP tasks, especially on
English. In this work, we innovatively develop two component-enhanced Chinese
character embedding models and their bi-gram extensions. Distinguished from
English word embeddings, our models explore the compositions of Chinese
characters, which often serve as semantic indictors inherently. The evaluations
on both word similarity and text classification demonstrate the effectiveness
of our models.
