Abstract#==#Current studies on Knowledge Base Population (KBP) tasks, such as slot filling,
show the particular importance of entity-oriented automatic relevant document
acquisition. Richer, diverse and reliable relevant documents satisfy the
fundamental requirement that a KBP system explores the attributes of an entity,
such as provenance-based background knowledge extraction (e.g., a personâ€™s
religion, origin,  etc.). Towards the bottleneck problem between
comprehensiveness and definiteness of acquisition, we propose a fuzzy-to-exact
matching based collaborative archiving method. In particular we introduce topic
modeling methodologies into entity profiling, so as to build a bridge between
fuzzy and exact matching. On one side of the bridge, we employ the topics in a
small-scale set of high-quality relevant documents (i.e., exact matching
results) to summarize the life slices of a target entity (i.e., so-called
biography).  On the other side, we use the biography as a reliable reference
material to detect new truly relevant documents from a large-scale
semi-finished pseudo-feedback (i.e., fuzzy matching results). We leverage the
archiving method in state-of-the-art slot filling systems. Experiments on
TAC-KBP data show significant improvement.
