Abstract#==#We present a novel model for the task of joint mention extraction and
classification. Unlike existing approaches, our model is able to effectively
capture overlapping mentions whose lengths are unbounded. Our model is highly
scalable, with a time complexity that is linear in the number of words in the
input sentence and linear in the number of possible mention classes. The model
can be extended to additionally capture mention heads explicitly in a joint
manner under the same time complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model through extensive experiments on standard datasets.
