Abstract#==#This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of a Long Short-Term Memory language
model
in our initial efforts to generate unconstrained rap lyrics. The goal of this
model is to generate lyrics that are similar in style to that of a given
rapper, but not identical to existing lyrics: this is the task of ghostwriting.
Unlike previous work, which defines explicit templates for lyric generation,
our model defines its own rhyme scheme, line length, and verse length. Our
experiments show that a Long Short-Term Memory language model produces better
"ghostwritten" lyrics than a baseline model.
