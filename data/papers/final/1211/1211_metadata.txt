Abstract#==#Speech translation is conventionally carried out by cascading an automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and a statistical machine translation (SMT) system.
The hypotheses chosen for translation are based on the ASR systemâ€™s acoustic
and language model scores, and typically optimized for word error rate,
ignoring the in- tended downstream use: automatic translation. In this paper,
we present a coarse- to-fine model that uses features from the ASR and SMT
systems to optimize this coupling. We demonstrate that several standard
features utilized by ASR and SMT systems can be used in such a model at the
speech-translation interface, and we provide empirical results on the Fisher
Spanish-English speech translation corpus.
