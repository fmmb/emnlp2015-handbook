Abstract#==#We present a higher-order inference system based on a formal compositional
semantics and the wide-coverage CCG parser. We develop an improved method to
bridge between the parser and semantic composition. The system is evaluated on
the FraCaS test suite. In contrast to the widely held view that higher-order
logic
is unsuitable for efficient logical inferences, the results show that a system
based on a reasonably-sized semantic lexicon
and a manageable number of non-first-order axioms enables efficient logical
inferences,
including those concerned with generalized quantifiers and intensional
operators,
and outperforms the state-of-the-art first-order inference system.
