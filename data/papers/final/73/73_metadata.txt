Abstract#==#In November 2014, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to directly supervise
the largest banks in the Eurozone via the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). 
While supervisory risk assessments are usually based on quantitative data and
surveys, this work explores whether sentiment analysis is capable of measuring
a bank's attitude and opinions towards risk by analyzing text data. For
realizing this study, a collection consisting of more than 500 CEO letters and
outlook sections extracted from bank annual reports is built up. Based on these
data, two distinct experiments are conducted. The evaluations find promising
opportunities, but also limitations for risk sentiment analysis in banking
supervision. At the level of individual banks, predictions are relatively
inaccurate. In contrast, the analysis of aggregated figures revealed strong and
significant correlations between uncertainty or negativity in textual
disclosures and the quantitative risk indicator's future evolution. Risk
sentiment analysis should therefore rather be used for macroprudential analyses
than for assessments of individual banks.
