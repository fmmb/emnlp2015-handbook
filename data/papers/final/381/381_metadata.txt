Abstract#==#Lexical selection is of great importance to statistical machine translation. In
this paper, we propose a graph-based framework for collective lexical
selection. The framework is established on a translation graph that captures
not only local associations between source-side content words and their target
translations but also target-side global dependencies in terms of relatedness
among target items. We also introduce a random walk style algorithm to
collectively identify translations of source-side content words that are
strongly related in translation graph. We validate the effectiveness of our
lexical selection framework on Chinese-English translation. Experiment results
with large-scale training data show that our approach significantly improves
lexical selection.
