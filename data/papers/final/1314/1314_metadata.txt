Abstract#==#The widespread use of deception in online sources has motivated the need for
methods to automatically profile and identify deceivers. This work explores
deception, gender and age detection in short texts using a machine learning
approach. First, we collect a new open domain deception dataset also containing
demographic data such as gender and age. Second, we extract feature sets
including n-grams, shallow and deep syntactic features, semantic features, and
syntactic complexity and readability metrics. Third, we build classifiers that
aim to predict deception, gender, and age. Our findings show that while
deception detection can be performed in short texts even in the absence of a
pre-determined domain, gender and age prediction in deceptive texts is a
challenging task. We further explore the linguistic differences in deceptive
content that relate to deceivers gender and age and find evidence that both age
and gender play an important role in people's word choices when fabricating
lies.
