Abstract#==#We introduce a new approach to argumentation mining that we applied to a
parallel German/English corpus of short texts annotated with argumentation
structure. We focus on structure prediction, which we break into a number of
subtasks: relation identification, central claim identification, role
classification, and function classification. Our new model jointly predicts
different aspects of the structure by combining the different subtask
predictions in the edge weights of an evidence graph; we then apply a standard
MST decoding algorithm. This model not only outperforms two reasonable
baselines and two data-driven models of global argument structure for the
difficult subtask of relation identification, but also improves the results for
central claim identification and function classification and it compares
favorably to a complex mstparser pipeline.
