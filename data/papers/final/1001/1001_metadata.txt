Abstract#==#We describe an approach for machine learning-based empty category detection on
the phrase structure analysis of Japanese.
The problem are formalized as tree node classification, 
we find that conjunction between path features and other node component
features, namely, head word feature, child feature and empty category feature, 
are highly effective.
We also find that a set of dot products between the word embeddings for a verb
and those for case particles can be used as a substitution for case frames.
The experiment results showed that the proposed method outperformed the
previous state of the art from 68.6% to 73.2% in F-measure.
