Abstract#==#Improving the search and browsing experience in PubMed is a key component in
helping users detect information of interest. In particular, when exploring a
novel field, it is important to provide a comprehensive view for a specific
subject. One solution for providing this panoramic picture is to find
sub-topics from a set of documents. We propose a method that finds sub-topics
that we refer to as themes and computes representative titles based on a set of
documents in each theme. The method combines a thematic clustering algorithm
and the Pool Adjacent Violators algorithm to induce significant themes. Then,
for each theme, a title is computed using PubMed document titles and
theme-dependent term scores. We tested our system on five disease sets from
OMIM and evaluated the results based on normalized point-wise mutual
information and MeSH terms. For both performance measures, the proposed
approach outperformed LDA. The quality of theme titles were also evaluated by
comparing them with manually created titles.
