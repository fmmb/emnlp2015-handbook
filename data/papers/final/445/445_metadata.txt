Abstract#==#Most of the current automated essay scoring (AES) systems are trained
using manually graded essays from a specific prompt.  These systems
experience a drop in accuracy when used to grade an essay from a
different prompt.  Obtaining a large number of manually graded essays
each time a new prompt is introduced is costly and not viable.              We
propose domain adaptation as a solution to adapt an AES system from an
initial prompt to a new prompt.  We also propose a novel domain
adaptation technique that uses Bayesian linear ridge regression.  We
evaluate our domain adaptation technique on the publicly available
Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) dataset and show that our
proposed technique is a competitive default domain adaptation
algorithm for the AES task.
