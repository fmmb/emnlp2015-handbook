Abstract#==#We propose an image-mediated learning approach for cross-lingual document
retrieval where no or only a few parallel corpora are available. Using the
images in image-text documents of each language as the hub, we derive a common
semantic subspace bridging two languages by means of generalized canonical
correlation analysis. For the purpose of evaluation, we create and release a
new document dataset consisting of three types of data (English text, Japanese
text, and images). Our approach substantially enhances retrieval accuracy in
zero-shot and few-shot scenarios where text-to-text examples are scarce.
