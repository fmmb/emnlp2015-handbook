Abstract#==#Many state-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) evaluation metrics are complex,
involve extensive external resources (e.g. for paraphrasing) and require tuning
to achieve best results. We present a simple alternative approach based on
dense vector spaces and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in particular Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. For WMT-14, our new metric scores best for
two out of five language pairs, and overall best and second best on all
language pairs, using Spearman and Pearson correlation, respectively. We also
show how training data is computed automatically from WMT ranks data.
