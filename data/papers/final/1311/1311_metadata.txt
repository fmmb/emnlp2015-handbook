Abstract#==#Events and their coreference offer useful semantic and discourse resources. We
show that the semantic and discourse aspects of events interact with each
other. However, traditional approaches addressed event extraction and event
coreference resolution either separately or sequentially, which limits their
interactions. This paper proposes a document-level structured learning model
that simultaneously identifies event triggers and resolves event coreference.
We demonstrate that the joint model outperforms a pipelined model by 6.9 BLANC
F1 and 1.8 CoNLL F1 points in event coreference resolution using a corpus in
the biology domain.
