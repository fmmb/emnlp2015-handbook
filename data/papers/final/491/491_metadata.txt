Abstract#==#Non-compositionality of multi word expressions is an intriguing problem that
can be the source of error in a variety of NLP tasks such as language
generation, machine translation and word sense disambiguation. In this work we
present a method of detecting non-compositional English noun compounds by
learning a composition function. We explore a range of possible models for
semantic composition, empirically evaluate these models and propose an
improvement method over the most accurate ones. We show that a complex function
such as polynomial projection can learn semantic composition and identify
non-compositionality in an unsupervised way, beating all other baselines
ranging from simple to complex. 
We show further improvements by also training a decomposition function, and
with a form of EM algorithm over latent compositionality annotations.
