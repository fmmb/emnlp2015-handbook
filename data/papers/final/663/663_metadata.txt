Abstract#==#Parameter tuning is a key problem for statistical machine translation (SMT).
Most popular parameter tuning algorithms for SMT are agnostic of the decoding
algorithm, resulting in parameters vulnerable to search errors in decoding. The
recent research of “search-aware tuning” (Liu and Huang, 2014) address this
problem by forcing the tuning algorithms to consider the translation
derivations in every decoding step to make promising partial translations more
likely to survive the in-exact decoding beam. We extend this approach from
phrase-based translation to syntax-based translation by generalizing the
translation quality metrics for partial translations to handle tree-structured
derivations in a way inspired by inside-outside algorithm. Our approach is
simple to use and can be applied to all conventional parameter tuning methods
as a plugin. Extensive experiments on Chinese-to- English translation show
significant BLEU improvements in MERT and MIRA.
