Abstract#==#Trending topics in microblogs such as Twitter are valuable resources
  to understand social aspects of real-world events. To enable deep
  analyses of such trends, semantic annotation is an effective
  approach; yet the problem of annotating microblog trending topics is
  largely unexplored by the research community. In this work, we
  tackle the problem of mapping trending Twitter topics to entities
  from Wikipedia. We propose a novel model that complements
  traditional text-based approaches by rewarding entities that exhibit
  a high temporal correlation with topics during their burst time
  period. By exploiting temporal information from the Wikipedia edit
  history and page view logs, we have improved the annotation
  performance by 17-28%, as compared to the competitive baselines.
