Abstract#==#Word embeddings encode semantic meanings of words into low-dimension word
vectors. In most word embeddings, one cannot interpret the meanings of specific
dimensions of those word vectors. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has
been proposed to learn interpretable word embeddings via non-negative
constraints. However, NMF methods suffer from scale and memory issue because
they have to maintain a global matrix for learning. To alleviate this
challenge, we propose online learning of interpretable word embeddings from
streaming text data. Experiments show that our model consistently outperforms
the state-of-the-art word embedding methods in both representation ability and
interpretability. The source code of this paper can be obtained from
