Abstract#==#Probabilistic topic models are widely used to discover latent topics in
document collections, while latent feature vector representations of words have
been used to obtain high performance in many NLP tasks. In this paper, we
extend two different Dirichlet multinomial topic models by incorporating latent
feature vector representations of words trained on very large corpora to
improve the word-topic mapping learnt on a smaller corpus. Experimental results
show that by using information from the external corpora, our new models
produce significant improvements on topic coherence, document clustering and
document classification tasks, especially on datasets with few or short
documents.
