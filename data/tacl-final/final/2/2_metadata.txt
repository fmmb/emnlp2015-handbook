Abstract#==#Online discussion forums and community question-answering websites provide one
of the primary avenues for online users to share information. In this paper, we
propose text mining techniques which aid users navigate
troubleshooting-oriented data such as questions asked on forums and their
suggested solutions. We introduce Bayesian generative models of the
troubleshooting data and apply them to two interrelated tasks (a) predicting
the complexity of the solutions (e.g., plugging a keyboard in the computer is
easier compared to installing a special driver) and (b) presenting them in a
ranked order from least to most complex. Experimental results show that our
models are on par with human performance on these tasks, while outperforming
baselines based on solution length or readability.
