Abstract#==#Space-delimited words in Turkish and Hebrew text can be further segmented into
meaningful units, but syntactic and semantic context is necessary to predict
segmentation. At the same time, predicting correct syntactic structures relies
on correct segmentation. We present a graph-based lattice dependency parser
that operates on morphological lattices to represent different segmentations
and morphological analyses for a given input sentence. The lattice parser
predicts a dependency tree over a path in the lattice and thus solves the joint
task of segmentation, morphological analysis, and syntactic parsing. We conduct
experiments on the Turkish and the Hebrew treebank and show that the joint
model outperforms three state-of-the-art pipeline systems on both data sets.
Our work corroborates findings from constituency lattice parsing for Hebrew and
presents the first results for full lattice parsing on Turkish.
