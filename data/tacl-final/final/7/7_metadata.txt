Abstract#==#Simple Wikipedia has dominated simplification research in the past 5 years. In
this opinion paper, we argue that focusing on Wikipedia limits simplification
research. We back up our arguments with corpus analysis and by highlighting
statements that other researchers have made in the simplification literature.
We introduce a new simplification dataset that is a significant improvement
over Simple Wikipedia, and present a novel quantitative-comparative approach to
study the quality of simplification data resources.
