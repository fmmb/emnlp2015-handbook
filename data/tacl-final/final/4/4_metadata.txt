Abstract#==#Discourse relations bind smaller linguistic units into coherent texts.
Automatically identifying discourse relations is difficult, because it requires
understanding the semantics of the linked arguments. A more subtle challenge is
that it is not enough to represent the meaning of each argument of a discourse
relation, because the relation may depend on links between lower-level
components, such as entity mentions. Our solution computes distributed meaning
representations for each discourse argument by composition up the syntactic
parse tree. We also perform a downward compositional pass to capture the
meaning of coreferent entity mentions. Implicit discourse relations are then
predicted from these two representations, obtaining substantial improvements on
the Penn Discourse Treebank.
