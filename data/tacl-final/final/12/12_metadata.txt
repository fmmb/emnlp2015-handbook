Abstract#==#Machine learning approaches to coreference resolution vary greatly in the
modeling of the problem: while early approaches operated on the mention pair
level, current research focuses on ranking architectures and antecedent trees.
We propose a unified representation of different approaches to coreference
resolution in terms of the structure they operate on. We represent several
coreference resolution approaches proposed in the literature in our framework
and evaluate their performance. Finally, we conduct a systematic analysis of
the output of these approaches, highlighting differences and similarities.
