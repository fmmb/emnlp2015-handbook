Abstract#==#Corpus-based distributional semantic models capture degrees of semantic
relatedness among the words of very large vocabularies, but have problems with
logical phenomena such as entailment, that are instead elegantly handled by
model-theoretic approaches, which, in turn, do not scale up. We combine the
advantages of the two views by inducing a mapping from distributional vectors
of words (or sentences) into a Boolean structure of the kind in which natural
language terms are assumed to denote. We evaluate this Boolean Distributional
Semantic Model (BDSM) on recognizing entailment between words and sentences.
The method achieves results comparable to a state-of-the art SVM, degrades more
gracefully when less training data are available and displays interesting
qualitative properties.
