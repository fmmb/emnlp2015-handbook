Abstract#==#We present a model of unsupervised phonological lexicon discovery -- the
problem of simultaneously learning phoneme-like and word-like units from
acoustic input. Our model builds on earlier models of unsupervised phone-like
unit discovery from acoustic data (Lee and Glass, 2012), and unsupervised
symbolic lexicon discovery using the Adaptor Grammar framework (Johnson et al.,
2006), integrating these earlier approaches using a probabilistic model of
phonological variation. We show that the model is competitive with
state-of-the-art spoken term discovery systems, and present analyses exploring
the model's behavior and the kinds of linguistic structures it learns.
