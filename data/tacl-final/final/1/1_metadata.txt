Abstract#==#Annotated data is prerequisite for many NLP applications. Acquiring large-scale
annotated corpora is a major bottleneck, requiring significant time and
resources. Recent work has proposed turning annotation into a game to increase
its appeal and lower its cost; however, current games are largely text-based
and closely resemble traditional an notation tasks. We propose a new linguistic
annotation paradigm that produces annotations from playing graphical video
games. The effectiveness of this design is demonstrated using two video games:
one to create a mapping from WordNet senses to images, and a second game that
performs Word Sense Disambiguation. Both games produce accurate results. The
first game yields annotation quality equal to that of experts and a cost
reduction of 73% over equivalent crowdsourcing; the second game provides a
16.3% improvement in accuracy over current state-of-the-art sense
disambiguation games with WordNet.
