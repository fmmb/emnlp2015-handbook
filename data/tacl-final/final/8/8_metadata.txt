Abstract#==#Supervised methods can achieve high performance on NLP tasks, such as Named
Entity Recognition (NER), but new annotations are required for every new domain
and/or genre change. This has motivated research in minimally supervised
methods such as semisupervised learning and distant learning, but neither
technique has yet achieved performance levels comparable to those of supervised
methods. Semi-supervised methods tend to have very high precision but
comparatively low recall, whereas distant learning tends to achieve higher
recall but lower precision. This complementarity suggests that better results
may be obtained by combining the two types of minimally supervised methods. In
this paper we present a novel approach to Arabic NER using a combination of
semi-supervised and distant learning techniques. We trained a semi-supervised
NER classifier and another one using distant learning techniques, and then
combined them using a variety of classifier combination schemes, including the
Bayesian Classifier Combination (BCC) procedure recently proposed for sentiment
analysis. According to our results, the BCC model leads to an increase in
performance of 8 percentage points over the best base classifiers.
