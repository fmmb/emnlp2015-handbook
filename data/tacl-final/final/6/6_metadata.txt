Abstract#==#Identifying and linking named entities across information sources is the basis
of knowledge acquisition and at the heart of Web search, recommendations, and
analytics. An important problem in this context is cross-document co-reference
resolution (CCR): computing equivalence classes of textual mentions denoting
the same entity, within and across documents. Prior methods employ ranking,
clustering, or probabilistic graphical models using syntactic features and
distant features from knowledge bases. However, these methods exhibit
limitations regarding run-time and robustness.
This paper presents the CROCS framework for unsupervised CCR, improving the
state of the art in two ways. First, we extend the way knowledge bases are
harnessed, by constructing a notion of semantic summaries for intra-document
co-reference chains using co-occurring entity mentions belonging to different
chains. Second, we reduce the computational cost by a new algorithm that embeds
sample-based bisection, using spectral clustering or graph partitioning, in a
hierarchical clustering process. This allows scaling up CCR to large corpora.
Experiments with three datasets show significant gains in output quality,
compared to the best prior methods, and the run-time efficiency of CROCS.
