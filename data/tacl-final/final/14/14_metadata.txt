Abstract#==#Translated texts are distinctively different from original ones, to the extent
that supervised text classification methods can distinguish between them with
high accuracy. These differences were proven useful for statistical machine
translation. However, it has been suggested that the accuracy of translation
detection deteriorates when the classifier is evaluated outside the domain it
was trained on.
We show that this is indeed the case, in a variety of evaluation scenarios. We
then show that unsupervised classification is highly accurate on this task. We
suggest a method for determining the correct labels of the clustering outcomes,
and then use the labels for voting, improving the accuracy even further.
Moreover, we suggest a simple method for clustering in the challenging case of
mixed-domain datasets, in spite of the dominance of domain-related features
over translation-related ones. The result is an effective, fully-unsupervised
method for distinguishing between original and translated texts that can be
applied to new domains with reasonable accuracy.
