Abstract#==#Distant supervision is a useful technique for creating relation classifiers in
the absence of labelled data. The approaches are often evaluated using a
held-out portion of the distantly labelled data, thereby avoiding the need for
lablelled data entirely. However, held-out evaluation means that systems are
tested against noisy data, making it difficult to determine their true
accuracy. This paper examines the effectiveness of using held-out data to
evaluate relation extraction systems by comparing the results that are produced
with those generated using manually labelled versions of the same data. We
train classifiers to detect two UMLS Metathesaurus relations (may-treat and
may-prevent) in Medline abstracts. A new evaluation data set for these
relations is made available. We show that evaluation against a distantly
labelled gold standard tends to overestimate performance and that no direct
connection can be found between improved performance against distantly and
manually labelled gold standards.
