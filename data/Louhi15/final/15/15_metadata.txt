Abstract#==#Cancer stages, which summarizes extent of cancer progression, is an important
tool for evidence-based medical research. However, they are not always recorded
in the electronic medical record. In this paper, we describe work for
annotating a medical text corpus with the goal of predicting patient level
liver cancer staging in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Our annotation
consisted of identifying 11 parameters, used to calculate liver cancer staging,
at the text span level as well as at the patient level. Also at the patient
level, we annotated stages for three commonly-used liver cancer staging
schemes. Our inter-rater agreement showed text annotation consistency 0.73 F1
for partial text match and 0.91 F1 at the patient level. After annotation, we
performed several document classification experiments for the text span
annotations using standard machine learning classifiers, including decision
trees, maximum entropy, naive Bayes and support vector machines. Thereby, we
identified baseline performances for our task at 0.63 F1 as well as strategies
for future improvement.
