Abstract#==#We present a distributional approach to the
problem of inducing parameters for un-
seen words in probabilistic parsers. Our
KNN-based algorithm uses distributional
similarity over an unlabelled corpus to
match unseen words to the most similar
seen words, and can induce parameters
for those unseen words without retrain-
ing the parser. We apply this to domain
adaptation for three different parsers that
employ fine-grained syntactic categories,
which allows us to focus on modifying the
lexicon, while leaving the structure of the
parser itself intact. We demonstrate up-
lifts for dependency recovery of 2%-6%
on novel vocabulary in biomedical text.
