Abstract#==#A method to ﬁnd adverse drug reactions in electronic health records written
in Swedish is presented. A total of 14,751 health records were manually
classiﬁed into four groups. The records are normalised by pre-processing
using both dictionaries and manually created word lists. 
Three different supervised machine learning algorithm were used to ﬁnd the
best results; decision tree, random forest and LibSVM. The best performance on
a test dataset was with LibSVM obtaining a precision of 0.69 and a recall of
0.66, and an F-score of 0.67. Our method found 865 of 981 true positives
(88.2%) in a 3-class dataset which is an improvement of 49.5% over previous
approaches.
