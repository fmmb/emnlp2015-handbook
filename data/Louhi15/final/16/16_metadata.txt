Abstract#==#Health campaigns that aim to raise awareness and subsequently raise funds for
research and treatment are commonplace. While many local campaigns exist, very
few attract the attention of a global audience. One of those global campaigns
is Movember, an annual campaign during the month of November, that is directed
at men's health with special foci on cancer & mental health. Health campaigns
routinely use social media portals to capture people's attention. Recently,
researchers began to consider to what extent social media is effective in
raising the awareness of health campaigns. In this paper we expand on those
works by conducting an investigation across four different countries, while not
only restricting ourselves to the impact on awareness but also on fund-raising.
To that end, we analyze the 2013 Movember Twitter campaigns in Canada,
Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.
