Abstract#==#De-identification aims at preserving patient confidentiality while enabling the
use of clinical documents for furthering medical research. Herein, we aim to
evaluate patient re-identification chances on a corpus of clinical documents in
French. Personal Health Identifiers are automatically marked by a
de-identification system applied to the corpus, followed by reintroduction of
plausible surrogates. The resulting documents are shown to individuals with
varying knowledge of the documents and de-identification method. The
individuals are asked to re-identify the patients. The amount of information
recovered increases with familiarity with the documents and/or
de-identification method. Surrogate re-introduction with localization from the
same (vs. different) geographical area as the original documents is found more
effective. The amount of information recovered was not sufficient to
re-identify any of the patients, except when privileged access to the hospital
health information system and several documents about the same patient were
available.
