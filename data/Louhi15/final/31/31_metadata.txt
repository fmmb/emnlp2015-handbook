Abstract#==#Online health forums provide advice and emotional solace to their users from a
social network of people who have faced similar conditions. Continued
participation of users is thus critical to their success. In this paper, we
develop machine learning models for predicting whether or not a user will
continue to participate in an online health forum. The prediction models are
trained and tested over a large dataset collected from the support group based
social networking site dailystrength.org. We find that our models can predict
continued participation with over 83% accuracy after as little as 1 month
observing the user’s activities, and that performance increases rapidly up to
1 year of observation. We also show that features such as the time since a
user’s last activity are consistently predictive regardless of the length of
the observation period, while other features, such as the number of times a
user replies to others, decrease in predictiveness as the observation period
grows.
