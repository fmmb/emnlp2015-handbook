Abstract#==#The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is becoming more prevalent in
healthcare institutions world-wide. These digital records contain a wealth of
information on patients' health in the form of Natural Language text. The
electronic format of the clinical notes has evident advantages in terms of
storage and shareability, but also makes it easy to duplicate information from
one document to another through copy-pasting. Previous studies have shown that
(copy-paste-induced) redundancy can reach high levels in American EHRs, and
that these high levels of redundancy have a negative effect on the performance
of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools that are used to process EHRs
automatically. In this paper, we present a preliminary study on the level of
redundancy in French EHRs. We study the evolution of redundancy over time, and
its occurrence in respect to different document types and sections in a small
corpus comprising of three patient records (361 documents). We find that
average redundancy levels in our subset are lower than those observed in U.S.
corpora (respectively 33\% vs. up to 78\%), which may indicate different
cultural practices between these two countries. Moreover, we find no evidence
of the incremental increase (over time) of redundant text in clinical notes
which has been found in American EHRs. These results suggest that redundancy
mitigating strategies may not be needed when processing French EHRs.
