Abstract#==#Among the application domains of information extraction, the biomedical
domain is one of the most important ones. This is due to the large
amount of biomedical text sources including the vast scientific
literature and collections of patient reports written in natural
language. These sources contain a wealth of crucial knowledge that needs
to be mined. Typical mining tasks regard entity recognition,
entity-relation extraction, and event and event participant recognition.
Recently we witness an interest in the recognition of spatial
relationships between entities and of temporal relationships between
events. One of the most important problems in information extraction
regards dealing with a limited amount of examples that are manually
annotated by experts and that can be used for training the extraction
models.

In this talk we discuss how we can leverage knowledge contained in
unlabelled texts and ontological knowledge about known relationships
between the output labels used for the extractions. The former aspect
especially focuses on how to automatically create novel training
examples from the unlabelled data, the latter on how to integrate the
relationships in models for structured machine learning during training
and testing of the extraction models in the most efficient way. We show
promising results and point to directions of future research.
