Abstract#==#Choosing the right tokenizer is a non-trivial task, especially in the
biomedical domain, where it poses additional challenges, which if not resolved
means the propagation of errors in successive Natural Language Processing
analysis pipeline. This paper aims to identify these problematic cases and
analyze the out-put that, a representative and widely used set of tokenizers,
shows on them. This work will aid the decision making process of choosing the
right strategy according to the down-stream application. In addition, it will
help developers to create accurate tokenization tools or improve the existing
ones. A total of 14 problematic cases were described, show-ing biomedical
samples for each of them. The outputs of 12 tokenizers were provided and
discussed in relation to the level of agree-ment among tools.
