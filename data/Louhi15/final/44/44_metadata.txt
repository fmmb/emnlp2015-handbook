Abstract#==#Electronic health records have emerged as a promising source of information for
pharmacovigilance. Adverse drug events are, however, known to be heavily
underreported, which makes it important to develop capabilities to detect such
information automatically in clinical text. While machine learning offers
possible solutions, it remains unclear how best to represent clinical notes
in a manner conducive to learning high-performing predictive models. Here, 42
representations are explored in an empirical investigation using 27 real,
clinical datasets, indicating that combining local and global (distributed)
representations of words and named entities yields higher accuracy than using
either in isolation. Subsequent analyses highlight the relative importance of
various named entity classes for predicting adverse drug events.
