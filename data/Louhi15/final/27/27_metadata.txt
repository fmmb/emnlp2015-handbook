Abstract#==#Structuring of information helps people to gain a quick overview of complex
issues and facilitates the transfer of large amounts of data. In the medical
field, such data are transferred using defined standards (HL7, DICOM) or in
conjunction with terminology systems (SNOMED CT, ICD-10, LOINC). This paper
focuses on the structuring of diagnostic reports in the field of anatomic
pathology. It describes how to make the content of these reports semantically
understandable for machines. Finally, it will be shown that structured
pathology reports can be checked for completeness of content in a computerized
way by using terminological knowledge. For this purpose, an ontology has been
designed that describes the subdomain of reporting a radical prostatectomy
specimen.
