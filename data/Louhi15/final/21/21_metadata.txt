Abstract#==#National cancer registries collect cancer related information from multiple
sources and make it available for research. Part of this information originates
from pathology reports, and in this pre-study the possibility of a system for
automatic extraction of information from Norwegian pathology reports is
investigated. A set of 40 pathology reports describing breast cancer tissue
samples has been used to develop a rule based system for information
extraction.
To validate the performance of this system its output has been compared to the
data produced by experts doing manual encoding of the same pathology reports.
On average, a precision of $80$\%, a recall of $98$\% and an F-score of $86$\%
has been achieved, showing that such a system is indeed feasible.
