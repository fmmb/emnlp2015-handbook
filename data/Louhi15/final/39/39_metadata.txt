Abstract#==#Biomedical synonyms are important re-sources for Natural Language Processing in
Biomedical domain. Existing synonym re-sources (e.g., the UMLS) are not
complete. Manual efforts for expanding and enriching these resources are
prohibitively expensive. We therefore develop and evaluate approaches for
automated synonym extraction from Wikipedia. Using the inter-wiki links, we
extracted the candidate synonyms (anchor-text e.g., “increased thirst”) in
a Wikipedia page and the title (e.g., “polyuria”) of its cor-responding
linked page. We rank synonym candidates with word embedding and
pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF). Our results show that PRF-based re-ranking
outperformed word embedding based approach and a strong baseline using
inter-wiki link frequency. A hybrid method, Rank Score Combination, achieved
the best results. Our analysis also suggests that medical synonyms mined from
Wikipedia can increase the coverage of existing synonym resources such as UMLS.
