Abstract#==#Communication of follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on
imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to
identify and track radiology recommendations is an important barrier to
ensuring timely follow-up of patients especially with non-acute incidental
findings on imaging studies. We are in the process of building a natural
language processing (NLP) system to identify follow-up recommendations in
free-text radiology reports. In this paper, we describe our efforts in creating
a multi-institutional radiology report corpus annotated for follow-up
recommendation information. The annotated corpus will be used to train and test
the NLP system.
